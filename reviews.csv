79912,The teacher is engaging and gives real life examples.,5
27120,It is very concise straight to very important points which you could easily expand further by yourself.,5
25491,"The course is interesting.The peer-review assigment and grading system is the weak park of this course : you are asked to do a prototype in one week that must be reviewed ""pretty epic"" from the other students for the highest grade.",3
40819,"With the right balance of time spent on videos, good amount of scientific background supported by studies and excellent practical tips to put the theory into practice!Very clear language and simple / easy to follow structure.Learned a lot with it and highly commend it! Well done.",5

64344,"Great course , It gives the idea of how we should do classification from scratch as well as understanding the concept of how to handle large dataset during training. Boosting is one of the most important technique as what I have heard in machine learning and it's great to understand the concept of it.",5
95026,Nice course! Pushing you to practice and lert you act on your own to find accurate results.I thinks that this is the best way to learn if you want to start a career in Data Science,5
94231,briefly summarised the machine learning algorithms. Good place to start!,4
76851,Excellent! Best prof ever!,5
88332,"This course is very instructive and well-paced like the others in the specialization. However the Raspberry PI ecosystem has evolved since the course materials were created. Although it's still possible to follow the videos, I think it would make it easier to update some things a little bit.",3
106296,Good survey of techniques,4
30484,"The course is well structured, but most of the features in the exercises' pages were not working properly. I tried to access them via both my computer (macbook) and mobile phone, but in some cases I could not even complete the exercise or check the answers...",3
53743,Amazing course.,5
44316,Interesting to see how the brain actually works and applying it to my academic life. Different from other self-help books which are generally biased to the author's experience,5
68760,Poorly executed. Constant differences in data. tiresome to watch two supposedly very intelligent instructors amuse themselves by saying Bro and Dude. The use og graphlab is unnecessary and adds a layer of complication which adds no future value to your toolkit. Probably a lot of better executed Machine Learning courses out there,2
69966,The course material is well planned out and the content is methodical in execution. A Beginner should have no problem grasping new words and in grammar formation as there are frequent repetitions and revisions. Kudos to the team that enabled the short skits!!,5

55719,Excellent introductory course for Machine Learning. In a short time I not only managed to understand the important aspects of ML but also learned how to use linear algebra with Octave/Matlab. Thank you!,5
78183,such a great class. The class aim to give beginners a really nice and easy start so the students who are new to programming will not be intimated or frustrated. The professor is very funny and knowledgeable and make the whole class great fun. I really enjoyed the class and ready to finish the class and move on to the 2nd Python serie class.,5
35415,"Good course, but very introductory.",4
72455,"If you are considering this specialization I would recommend the Andrew Ng course instead and the main reason is that it isn't depend on proprietary ML framework. Despite the good lectures, the assignments don't help you develop the knowledge required for ML developer role.Taking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery, from summer 2016 to summer 2017, finally the most interesting part of the specialization was cancelled. I'm completely disappointed with the specialization learning expirience.",1
95389,Challenging course but worth the effort!,5

104907,"I've taken several statistics, data science, and R courses. This is one of the worst. I took others' advice, and I also strongly suggest looking to other sources to learn Statistical Inference before taking this course. Khan Academy, DataCamp, Udacity, Duke (Coursera), and Columbia (edX) all have great courses. Though they vary in depth, each leaves you with a good understanding of the concepts they teach.",1

88028,"Impressive, one learns a great deal about tasting techniques but also the basics of grape and wine variations. I just wish I had a better for detecting the aromas!",4
70915,Be warned - practice problems come from a textbook not available online or open-source. Forums do not offer much help or interaction. Material is presented clearly and lectures are well-delivered.,3
29694,"I think the course is very good, but the peer review grading should be improved! Sometime, people have to wait for more than 3 weeks to get their assignment graded, or they don't know whether they will get the grade. Thanks!",4

22874,Highlight: The concept of the course itself is great and the course is well structured that makes it easy to follow. It was very basic yet had a lot of new information that will help advance in more detailed programs.Lowlights: Need more focus and details on the Cost module.,4
103680,It is a fantastic course. I loved it. It fits my interests.,4

51475,It's a very useful course!,5
47568,"As with many subjects, it is what you think you know that prevents one from making progress; both from a perspective of the lack of a perceived need for continued work as well as new and counter-intuitive concepts that are the essence of new understandings.",4
32708,"Great course, i love it.",5
80647,Excellent approach and content.,5
18843,"Hi, I am an IT specialist (30 years experience). I undertook the course so I could learn about IBM Bluemix and IoT development, and extend my skills/understanding of the environment. However, I have very little good to say about this course offering. I had numerous issues with what was offered:The videos were generally ok, but some had poor audio. There was minimal video (compared to any other course I have done), and more detail and discussion in videos would have been more helpful.Some of the video material is out of date already, as I suspect Bluemix layout has changed - this made navigation a bit confusing.The downloadable Pi image has changed since the course was prepared, and the newer image has different code as standard. I ended up having to muddle-through manually loading packages and dependencies, etc. to get things to work.I lost many hours trying to debug and rework assignment code, just to get it to work for the grader tool. This was further complicated by not having good debug output from the grader to work with. Naturally some of the grader fails were my own fault, but the majority of issues I ran in to could have been avoided by better worded assignments and/or more detail about requirements.Lastly, it was taking sometimes days to get any response to requests for guidance on the forums / discussions. In fact, I think the majority of useful assistance came from other students who had run in to the same issue(s). When you have a course that is such a short time frame, you really need to be providing assistance in a timely manner.I could not, in any good faith, recommend anyone take this course in the future - which is a little saddening. I do thank the lecturers for their efforts thus far, and sincerely hope they can either improve or drop this course offering in the future.",1
74723,Wonderful course!!! for every one!,5
82966,"excellent course. i love it very much, it's very useful.",5
21946,This course is of lower quality than the preceding courses. The final assignment instructions are not clear. The forums helped but I have the impression that they are not really followed by the mentors.,3
94149,"Sharp, immediately-actionable and very well presented. Five thumbs up.",5

96737,Excellent course with useful examples. I really recommend this course.,5
25818,"I tried other complex Unity3d courses online, and this one beats them all in the way it is built stage by stage. It doesn't pile too much information from the start, and lets you use pre-generated complex assests first, and only later explains them gradually. Even though I had some basic tutorial in Unity3d I couldn't imagine getting that far within a month, investing only about 3-4 hours on the lectures. The projects themselves consume as much time as you want/have to put into, with at least 3-4 hours on average, but if you want to really learn and improve your skill, it requires a lot more than that.",5
37113,great intro for js and front end newbies,5
39469,Thanks for this wonderful course.,5
56752,Amazing course. Through my first week now and it's a really good course,5
68370,"A Brilliant introduction to Machine Learning, I've tried several courses before but none of them got me engaged like this one. The instructors have a lot of knowledge and present the material in a very easy to understand way. Also the assignments and technical work is really engaging and challenges you to really learn the language and the concepts.",5
76839,The course is a great start. The professor really makes it fun to learn and uses good techniques to make concepts easy to understand.,5
29516,"great course!!, I bet a lot of people will be interested into a second part to this course!!, keep up the good work",5

96595,"Thank you professor Jogesh K Muppala.This is one of the best courses in the UI domain and any one interested must attend.The best part was the hands on teaching methodology and added to this the spice up was ""What mistake I made"" - learn and correct by validating other participants work... I enjoyed it..... :)Apologies for always been the late latif in submissions...",5
59114,"Audio quality is not great. Also, all concepts could be easily taught in Python rather than Matlab.Great material never the less.",3
83284,Love the clarity of the instructors deliver which is supported by great explanations and most importantly visual aids & demonstrations. Ps... Especially loved the bloopers at the end. Nice treat! :),5
68167,Great course and instructors! Thanks!,5
84218,I learned a lot of information which I didn't know before although I passed other course on Python,5
22631,Nice and Succinct! Considering others in the specialization because of this.,5
93904,Great course with an entertaining lecturer,5
39490,This course is bit disappointing because of the way it has been presented. Ideally the speaker should focus on detailing the points highlighted in the slides but in this course the speaker is just passing on the same information which are there on slides without adding much value. Although i was deeply interested in this subject and would look forward to the revised version of the same.,2
41504,Highly recommended!!,5
90342,it is a wonderful course!,5
96060,"This course has been immensely helpful in teaching how to teach the violin. I recently started teaching violin lessons and I am so much more confident about instructing my students correctly from the beginning, thanks to this course. It was fantastic to see the teaching happening, making the course practical, not just theoretical. Thank you!",5
95706,"Fantastic discussion and live examples of pieces. This course gave me a wonderful overview and context for understanding the development of the string quartet. What I found most fascinating was the pure objectivity in the lectures and the plethora of styles I was introduced to that previously I had not known (Webern, Smetana and Shostakovitch). Both Mr. Steinhardt and Ms Chung are excellent scholars. I highly recommend this course as it gives you a lifetime of specific quartets to get to know.",5

27119,Appreciate this course!!!! I have been given a foundation and will continue to build upon my understanding. :),5
89958,I love the course's content but discussions are of poor quality and the honors tracks assignments are a little messy. I ought having more explanation about the tool to use or maybe doing the programming assignments in another tool/language than Lenskit even it seems like a decent project.,4
56034,"Loved this course. When I started I thought even basic machine learning was way too complex, and how wrong was I? Andrew makes machine learning approachable and fun. The best part of the course was the tips to approach ml problems and debug them. Recommend. Recommend. Recommend.",5

71412,"Really good intro to functional programming, make sure you practice a lot!",5
41414,"Does very little to actually help you learn JAVA. Explains nothing about why the language works as it does.. Also it insists on you using their libraries and programming environments. You spend perhaps 20% of your time actually practicing coding, and the rest is wasted in libraries you will never use again. Such a waste",1
103611,"Very good instructor, easy to follow and to remember what was explained. This course fulfilled my expectations by giving a good overview on the topic and a basis for further studies. I also liked that the tests were not too easy and covered all the topics explained in the videos. This makes it easier to remember them.",5
84993,Awesome course. Loved it,5
65882,"Great learning experience!I enjoyed all the videos, the presented material, and the interaction with other students enrolled in the course... I will recommend this course to anyone interested in this topic :-)",5
26111,"The instructor videos were clear and informative. The course had a balanced mix of game development theory and practical exercises. Solid introduction to the Unity game design platform. The projects increased in difficulty and time commitment as the course progressed, building on prior knowledge. The peer review of game files was challenging at times, but it was a good experience to create actual games.",4

17216,"Great course, great materials!",5
56067,"It's unbelievable that I can learn more sitting miles away than by sitting in an actual class. And the sole reason for that is the tremendous work Prof. Ng, the mentors and all others related to the course have put in in bringing this course online. Videos are extremely well explained and the programming assignments are just the right amount of challenging that leave a sense of satisfaction upon completion. It's a wonderful and unique attribute for a course to have its students attached to it. This one managed to achieve just that. Thanks!",5
47695,Just perfect! Really informative and fun at the same time!,5
51048,"Great introductory course! I had no doubt that there was a connection between what we eat and our health, but I had very little to no idea how much microbes are involved in our being. I enjoyed this course very much and will recommend it to others!Thank you!",5

23315,very insightful....,4
26523,"Have completed 3 weeks, and find the course very good.Lot of effort to build the content, very clear and detailed and explanation and if you repeat it yourself while going thru the lecture, the concepts will be get much more clearer.Programming is all about practice, but this could be a very good starting point.",4
68185,Very good course for quick learning !!,5
95100,"As a python newbie, I found this course challenging yet so much fun to learn. Dr. Brooks presented the lectures in a very organized way and made them easy to follow. If you have experience in R, you probably would pick up Pandas real quick. Students are expected to devote a lot of time into the assignments and try to find the answer on your own. But with all the great tips and clarifications from our diligent mentor Sophie Greene, it's definitely achievable.Will take the other courses in this specialization and definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested in data analysis.",5
42024,"It's a very instructive course. Within 6 days, I turned from not knowing anything about Adobe Illustrator to become very fond of it.One caveat, though: Adobe Illustrator CC free license only allows you a 7-day of free use (not 1 month as mentioned in the lecture), so you'd better be able to do all the projects within those 7 days if you want to use it for free.",4

43042,"I took this course as a preparatory course based on my intent to invest more time in the Coursera course catalog. In addition to providing useful tips and practical study habits and techniques, the lessons also provides insight into brain function and specifically those techniques which help the brain register and maintain the information it absorbs.

15621,This course has been unbelievably useful. It has exceeded my hopes. It is well taught and the assignments have really challenged me. I have learnt just as much by reviewing the work of others. Thanks so much.,5
11006,"very poor. even though for the most part I found the videos engaging, the course's overall structure doesn't help to 'read the novel together', as is stated in the title. the quizes are poorly written, even for me, a native russian speaker, it was often hard to understand the questions, and sometimes its plain guess work on the opinions of the course authors. often a required number of answers to pass a quiz is the same as the total number of questions in that same quiz. the essay's topics rarely correspond with the actual reading of the book. for the very first week the essay required knowledge of the book that hasn't been read yet by the participants. or it should be stated that one needs to read the book prior to taking the course. then again that would require the change of the course's name.",1
29467,The course was good and the material was interesting. I wish that the course were more video-based however. There are some videos but they are meant to be played at specific points during the reading.,4
46176,"Excellent course for anyone who wants to be a better learner! This course is based on solid findings from neural science, and it gives many study tips.",5

29262,"I really liked this course. I have owned and trained dogs from a very early time in my life. I found it very interesting how dogs evolved from wolves and how that is apparent in dogs today. I typically like courses to be heavy on the science side, but this class was well presented for mid-level people or people who don't have a science background. Of course people will disagree with some of the material but overall it was an interesting class and the book recommended for the class was a good read. Mahalo from Hawaii",5

64081,"Very good course, with clear explanations of the key concepts. However, I felt hindered in being able to complete all tasks in the homeworks each week as many questions alienate someone like me with little mathematics/physics background. I feel if the questions were more general I would have been able to perform better each week. Very good lecture content though.",4
3266,Great Course for those who wants to go deeper in Front-End Frameworks,5
15374,I really enjoyed this course. Have been using Python for years but never jumped into data management and visualization. This course helped me doing that and presenting results in a beautiful and useful way.I am not rating with 5 starts because the rating system is cumbersome. I submitted my first assignment late and they were not peers to review my work so I am still waiting after a month of rejoining the course.,4

60693,Very Helpful!!,5
27175,Why 5 stars:1. The amount of effort to put the course together is evident. It is not easy to go over all the basics in such short videos but Yaakov has managed to construct the course in such a way that we have enough understanding to ask the right questions that we can then investigate.2. Practice quizzes after the lectures are very helful. They help us refresh the concepts and also give us a sense of confidence that we have understood the lecture.3. The on screen recording is done very well. No clutter or unnecessary clicks and easy to follow.4. Engages with students in the forums.Room for improvement:1. A cheat sheet document would be great. I am taking notes but wish I had an organized and concise document that contains the rules/syntax that need to be memorized.,5
68651,Excellent. Went through the introduction videos and course material. Great one. Thanks for publishing it .,5

64601,"A great course on predominantly the western course of history from 1760 to 1910; one that focuses on ideas and movements that shaped the world, not a course that focuses on western history for reasons of eurocentrism alone. Where the course is eurocentric, it is so by necessity, a symptom of a well-balanced, well-structured course that strives for an approach that poses questions in an earnest and truthful manner.The professor who runs this course is a highlight. His voice and presentation style makes the course that much easier to enjoy. I hope to later follow him and pay attention to his external writings and insights, even in my time beyond studying this online course.",5

5859,Loved the problem in the course.,5
33073,"I really enjoyed this course, it was very informative. My only complaint is that on quiz questions that included example code, sometimes the ends of lines were cut off. I had to copy and paste them into an editor to read the entire thing.",5
4489,"The course is more on analysis techniques as opposed to Excel shortcuts, tips and tricks. It certainly helps if you have a good background in algebra-level math; if you're looking for a course on how to be an Excel Power User, this might not be the best fit. Otherwise, what I learned here is useful for me. Thanks!",4
17998,too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment,1
11969,Very interesting and relevant course for anyone interested in research involving human subjects. The teachers are very good at making a 'boring' and difficult subject interesting by providing thorough examples and very good online hand-on tools. Excellent course!,5
95447,"Really handy and useful materials. However, if we can share our codes online after receiving the certificate will be really helpful. Cause although I finished the course, I still find some of my code is repetitive and not pandorable, and I would like to learn from other talents. Thanks Coursera and University of Michigan.",5

96608,Great introduction to Web UI Frameworks!,5
19804,"Nice introductory course. I thought Prof Balch was a interesting and engaging prof. The assignments were well thought out. Here are some tips: I would not recommend this course without a grasp of python. The more Python you know, the easier it will be. Next, and more importantly, spend time learning Pandas. Pandas is extraordinary, for timeseries data. You will save a tremendous amount of time as you get deeper into this subject if you have a grasp on Pandas. Read the professors text. It is compact and to the point. Expect that you will get more out of this course the harder you work. So, try your own experiments, read the recommended texts. Think of Prof Balch as more of a tour guide and it is up to you to go explore on your own.",5
53496,I learn a lot from this course.,5

64007,"Course contained unbelievable amount of silly busywork that has no place being implemented in MATLAB, while forbidding the use of most useful built in functions. At no point during the course was any of the MATLAB's strengths -- like easy solving of linear systems or vectorized operations, even suggested upon.Furthermore, the course has unhealthy interest in dates and calendars - again of course disabling all the built in tools.",1

92352,"Dr. Chuck is an excellent teacher. This is true particularly because he is so passionate about the subject and skilled in both the craft as well as helping others to learn it.For me, learning databases has been a very fun and liberating study. I needed it. I have been planning my own version of a personal finance application with all of the features and customization that I want in it for some time now. Learning databases was and is an important step in reaching the knowledge level that I think I need to attempt my project with some probability of success and happiness with the end product. I have done some event-driven programming in Python, and have messed around in someone else's GUI in that class, but designing and implementing my own GUI won't be easy. Thanks to Dr. Chuck's class series, however, I feel much more confident that I can go out there and review the different third party GUI libraries and see if any will get the job done for now.Alternatively, the University where Dr. Chuck teaches also has a web design certificate that seems like it might be useful. If GUI programming is too hard I might go with a web version since I have heard that Javascript, particularly jquery and D3 would make my task of graphing and presenting financial data quite doable.",5

321,"It's ok. Bushee is very knowledgeable and a very enthusiastic teacher, but his lessons are too dense compared to the content in the rest of the Wharton BA programs. I actually like all the detail, but I think it's covered too quickly and the course should probably be made longer to deal with it all. There are ratios and balance sheet jargon just flying at you at a breathless pace. It would be better to focus on a few key ones and then walk through the examples a little more slowly. The quizzes were extremely tricky with too many choose more than one answers. It was difficult to find the parts of the video to review missed questions because 1) the transcripts are machine generated and make it difficult to search specific words and 2) it's difficult to remember where the concept was covered because there was so much in each video.The last week felt very disconnected from the first week and like it belonged in a different course almost. It was pretty good, though. I liked how it contained specific examples and charts.",3

Also I always like working with maps and as this course assignments are based on map data, plotting data on real maps it like it more. But it would be great if the course have taught to execute the same code through java jar.

I have realised during the course that it is a fairly complex discipline for a beginner with no exposure to statistics and the terminology.Initially it might seem like over the top, but with some research and reading of suggested materials , one shall be able to get a hang of it in due time.I also believe the instructors have had to work hard to make sure the upper level course can be delivered as close as possible to the level of a beginner.My only suggestion is if they could add a list of sorts for statistical jargon , explained in layman terms, which would actually enable quicker absorbance.",5

21128,It delves into many important topics. I would advice to explore the topics in much more depth on your own. Overall a good breadth of topics.,4
31809,This course is more like an introductory of the whole specialization. It's simple BUT very clear for me to understand and catch up.,5
95660,I loved this particular course. The topics are relevant. Each topic is supported by historical facts and examples and how is it relevant in the present time. It was a great learning experience!!!,5

Some of the readings were challenging for me because I have not studied statistics, but it was a welcome challenge. I plan to return to some of the course materials after completing a stats 101 course.I took the survey questionnaire design course in this specialization two years ago and I wish I'd taken this first. If you're thinking of sampling courses from this specialization, I highly recommend you start here.",5

61505,"The course shows the basic concepts in analytics. I like the structure of it, each lesson has its objectives and conclusion, and presents the concepts in a clear manner.",5
20105,"4.5, Not perfect, but very clear and consistent (I'm only in week 2 and this is my first coursera course) there are some topics that I feel need a little more clarification, but that is my only complaint. Perhaps it would be a good idea for the site to have a FAQ for each individual course. The Professor or course instructor, could answer these questions for future course sessions. Perhaps there's a reason this idea wouldn't work, but it would be nice to see from the student's perspective.",4
67145,Learning a lot so far,5
46427,Was very helpful to establish some better learning techniques. Recommended to anyone before they take any other course.,5

2138,"This course is too much doggy! Please do not use Coursera for advertising your friendsÂ´companies, or at least learn how to do it a little more professionally to look really relevant! This psychiatric lady also seems to be sexits. Looking at differences between pictures with a girl and pictures with a boy is really abominable and shows an intentional discrimination and racism. It is really shameful.",1
40476,I think I can think better,5
93053,"Dr. Peng is great at teaching, and the lectures are not hard to follow. The recommended e-book is almost a transcript of the lectures' examples, and I really recommend getting it (I got it on print, as I like to make annotations while following the videos).That being said, the Programming Assignments are extremely difficult for anyone with no programming background. The Assignments do not require just what is being taught, and demands a lot of google and stack overflow research in order to solve the problems. If you are doing other Coursera courses and/or working at the same time, I recommend you invest time in this and do not let the assignments for the weekends.",3
28578,This course is intended to provide the concepts of Happiness what it is and how we relate to it. Prof Raj is amazing at explaining all this in details yet in common man simplicity.,5
58420,Very good! I enjoy this course and recommend it to every one interested in data learning and programming learner.,5
89952,"Generally I like the contents of this course. I particularly like that insights are provided in terms of what aspects to consider when designing a recommender system; pros and cons of different approaches. However I'm also extremely bored watching the videos because looking at the lectures reading the scripts (most of the time with very slow speed) is one of the quickest way to send people to sleep. I'd hope the lectures will improve their presenting skills.Another comment is the honours track assignments should really be put into more thoughts. I passed them with 100% credit, but I didn't feel I gained a lot useful knowledge through this exercise. Generally it felt to me that the complexity of the implementation is much much more than needed in relation to the complexity of the problems. Eventually this assignment became grinding with Java's verbose, annoying syntax and unnecessary computations designed in lab instruction. For example, in the first programming assignment, why if the ModelProvider object already computed the entire map of ratings, and the map is directly needed in the Recommender object, the Model object only provide API to retrieve individual rating but not the entire map?! Isn't it a wasteful computation to reconstruct the rating map? So I doubt the structural design of the program is sensible, or the expected solution would actually be done in real applications. Also I think Java is just a really out-dated, bulky language to work with in this kind of task. It really makes the assignment experience awful.",3
29696,Incredible!!! This course really improve my essay writing!,5
38997,"The course is well explained and he gives a clear understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, I hope there will be further and more complex JavaScript courses from these teacher.",5
30395,The course professor was excellent and made the rules on commas and parallel structure as well as verb tenses seem so simple. I was able to brush up my grammar rules and punctuation through the course.,5
1749,"What's the point of online education if one can only access the assignments if him has purchased the course? With no access to assignments, how could one evaluating his efficient of study?",1
50673,Wonderfully done.,5

105046,It was a very informative course that opened my eyes to the many approaches businesses can choose to operate in. I love the idea of a company that both takes on social responsibility while also making a profit. I also enjoyed the complexity of the issues at hand from unwittingly causing harm through a nice gesture to the positive image social awareness can bring a company.,5
4341,Not so comfortable with using Excel.,3
103185,"The course is interesting much to be learned and topics are open to much discussion. Some of the presentation need to be simplified and shortened. Repetitions tend to lose emphasis of the main ideas. Additional literature is welcome. But, to those of us whom love science and specially 'Brain mysteries' this course is a different perspective from those physiological or pathophysiological brain courses. Theoretical ideas of the brain are not easy topics; but it does make an interesting discussion. Thanks for the effort and the course is appreciated.",3

41610,"This course gives a good introduction to programming and computer graphics. It's well structured and well taught. Since I can already program in C#, I was hoping there would be less emphasis on learning to program and more emphasis on the graphics side. I would also prefer it if the platform for the graphics was the latest technology most commonly used by industry and I'm not sure Monogame is it. However, the lecturer was brilliant and it's a course you can enjoy doing!",4

78673,"Excellent overview of first few concepts in Programming in Python. Useful in understanding programming concepts (early early stages) for those who have never done programming and refresher for those who have, but it has been a while, I look forward to seeing how the other courses in the this series are. Only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is because I think in addition to the given assignments there should be an extra assignment per week with practical applications. Granted not enough of the language is know yet to warrant anything really complex, but perhaps just number converter for scientific notation, or a tip calculator with code given that can make it practical to use (connect it to a website or phone application).",4
3798,"Great beginner course for Arduino. People that are experienced with programming will probably end up zipping through some of the videos pretty fast or skipping some of them because the programming is very basic, that aside I found the lessons very interesting and would recommend them for anyone new to Arduino or wanting a refresher",5

20937,Good course for learning the basic on data visualization.,5
73202,"This course has been enlightening and enriching for me in terms of how governance works in America. The issues raised can be applicable to many other countries in the world. However, this is not the course for you if you are looking for theoretical and analytical skills as this course is structured around sharings and exchanges with public figures about the current and future agenda of the US. (This is just my personal opinion and others may disagree me with me on certain aspects.)",4
25452,Very interesting. The assignments test the learning are and more related to what we see around us. It is a test of our perception on interactive design. This is very helpful.,5

2532,"Prof. Jana S. Borg is the simply the best! Every lecture material (videos/exercises/final project) is carefully crafted to optimize student's learning experience. She's made the learning fun and that's not easy to do!Now, let's talk about the reason why I didn't give this course a full 5-star rating.... It's the students! As you might already know, this class requires us to put together a 5-minute screencast video that will demonstrate our understanding in 1) Tableau, 2) Business Analytics and 3) Presentation skills. Unfortunately, most of the students only care about the first one while blatantly ignoring the other two. And that makes the grading process a pain in the..errr.... you know what!Another important reminder. Be sure to submit the final project days before the deadline. Otherwise, you might be at risk of not getting graded by 3 other students! On the forum, a student claimed that she was forced to join this session because she couldn't get 3 peers to grade her project TWO SESSIONS ago! The horror!",4

Becase as a big procrastinator I thought that Ä° was born this way and cannot change anything.It is interesting to test the technique ""start hard jump easy"", because I always tried to finish easy task first in order to feel myself self confident and to finish as much item as possible quickly leaving lot of time for hard tasks.",5

Instead of dreading class I found myself excited about attending everyday and was able to progress faster than the course outline due to his extremely clear and supportive teaching method.

I have already started applying machine learning techniques in real life problems.Thanks to Stanford University and Mr. Andrew for providing such high quality content.,5
80566,"I have mixed feelings about this course. I notice that a lot of courses like these in US colleges are incredibly glorified. The professor sounds knowledgeable, I have to admit. The material, however, seems mostly like common sense. Most of it is life skills that you simply pick up over time. Just like business courses, people love to label everything concept or process with some kind of nice sounding term to make it look professional or whatever. Also, very boring.",2

104054,THE COURSE IS GOOD.,4
11800,the lessons were too long in duration and i was really bored because the teaching didn't have anything engaging me to be more eager to listen and all the slides were with the same background and design and there were no pictures or animation or fun stuff to create some kind of diversity in the progress of the course.,2
83042,It is impossible to submit quizes and programming assignments without purchasing the course. In my view this defies the goal of Coursera to provide accessible education anywhere in the world!,1

31065,"I would have liked some more depth in the course. While the course name says ""punctuation"", it deals only with commas and to a small extent, with semicolons. The assignments and practice exercises need to be tougher. Also, given that this course is taken by students from all over the globe, it should mention that the ""serial comma"" is not mandatory in all writing styles.",3

25065,"The interviews were great, and useful to see a real experienced designer, however the contents in the course were almost nonexistent. The homework was well planed but it depends much more in the student to learn something that the contents exposed in the videos.

93519,"This is a tougher class than advertised. I essentially had to clear my entire week's plans to complete the first week's assignment, which was by far the toughest. There needs to be more testing on a variety of incoming skill sets. The lectures can also benefit from a recalibration, because the lecturer speaks way too fast for newbies and speaks fastest when explaining the most complex concepts. This makes it tough to learn.",2
52839,"overall: some weeks were fun, some notin some weeks are too many chapters and exercises. I actually think that the exercises are too complicated compared to the examples in the chapters. Sometimes are the explanations in the chapters not sufficient.It would be helpful to know the name of a proof e.g. Perch's Law or law of (the) excluded middle.

While the equations are important, building the mental model around the strange world is way more essential to comprehending the special theory of relativity, and that is where this course shines. Professor Lagerstrom will look at the same problem in many different angles, cross referencing between them constantly, making sure the fundamentals of the theory sinks in.",5
92097,"Excellent structure. A course I really enjoyed and learnedPerhaps should add optional assignments for more experienced users, in order to intrigue them.

30495,"Even though the course was pretty basic, there were many new things I learned, especially certain tips and tricks. The lessons are simple; the examples were good for understanding and to the point. The course-content, video and audio qualities are good. Links to extra materials are also provided towards the end of each week.I felt the assignments were too simple. They were reviewed by other students and not by the course organisers. Though peer-review is a good practice, comments from the teachers would be much appreciated. I would prefer more options for discussion on a topic, other than through the assignments alone.",4
51450,This course it is excellent.,5
50022,"Hey guys.I've seen the new session started and enrolled just to write the review and a little story about myself.I've taken the course few years ago ( in August 2013) before all the recent changes on Coursera (Specializations etc.).At the moment I was finishing my university and realized - I had no clue what I was willing to do in my life (my primer occupation was ""Manager"" - like that's not depressing enough :) . *Joking* ). I saw the course and remember I had fun programming on Pascal in high school so I've decided: there is no harm to try programming once in a while.I was so amazed about my first steps, I started few other courses here and at MIT platform. I googled and read everything I could found. That was my ""idee fixe"" at the time.Long story short, few months later I got my first job as a software developer. Today, 3,5 years later, I'm Team Lead at my current project and one of the most payed employee at my company.I just want to thank Jennifer and Paul, as well as all the course team involved.Also to those who just studying right now - take your time and work hard. It totally worth it.Best regards, Viktor.",5

27359,Great insight into Sales forecasting. I liked it,4
14636,"It's a good first step into getting the right programs, learning key vocabulary, and interacting with important websites/programs at a very introductory level.If you are not from a math/statistics background you can still complete the course but you will not understand the previews for later courses completely, that is ok! But consider getting the eBook with this course.My only complaint is the quizzes, it often feels impossible to get a 5/5 based on only what you get from the lectures, there's always 1 question that is completely over the top compared to the other 4, but you can do the quizzes 3 times every 8 hours and just trial and error the 1 gotcha question on each quiz.",5
75816,great course,5
65018,It is very much useful to the beginners who are thinking about their career in the software fields.Because this course is very much helpful to get an internships.,4
105952,"WEEKS 1, 2, and 4 were AWESOME and had great information. Weeks 1,2, and 4 were very detailed and successfully communicated in a manner where an audience with or without a specialty in statistics can easily follow the logic, understand the purpose and think of how these tools/lessons can be applied in the varying worlds of risk, compliance, algorithms, and finance.I cannot say the same for week 3. Sadly, out of the whole certificate program it was this was the week I was most interested in (e.g. Goodness of Fit and identifying the Distribution of one's data) but, felt the week was poorly communicated, not supplemented with sufficient (if any) examples that one could tie into the real world, did not provide sufficient excel formulas, explanations, visuals or examples.",5
90703,"Very informative, but the coding elements can be somewhat difficult mainly because there's not many specific examples provided. It is still a very enlightening course. PS You definitely need to at the very least be very familiar with Differential Equations to take this.",3
58637,The machine learning course is simply magnificent. Andrew Ng simply clever.,5

17056,Excellent! The way the Professor explains the opics is very clear and engaging,5

78143,"very fundamental, but the instructor is tiresomely talkative...for example, when he talked about examples, he compared each two numbers again and again, what I want to is the logic to find the max/min number, not 49 is larger than 9!!!everyone knows it !! he compared every number every time ....it is boring!!! I will not choose this course if there are other python courses open at this time!!",3
9542,"Five stars, even though there were some errors in the quizes and inconsistencies of parsing E/e. But that's a minor issue when you have such an amazing lectures in the course. I've praised Jim for Calculus Two and I praise him again for this course. Superb instructor, the best I've seen thus far after working on tens of Math/CS MOOCs. I wish there were more courses from him, a really gifted teacher and amazing mathematician.",5

68581,"This is course is great and the way its been taught by professors is very cool :)I am getting to know the use case and than how we are going to do it, rather than conventional other way round. I am so happy that we first come to know about the application and its so important for a student to know that.Thank you so much, only problem I see is that this course should have been started earlier :)",5
20164,Great and very practical course.,5
71188,"Befor this course I've finished ""Programming in Scala"" (3 ed.) so there were no groundbreaking ideas for me. And still it was useful to check my knowledges by taking assignments. I'd recommend this course for anyone who is learning Scala",5

24186,very informative and interesting,5
41531,I found this course to be very enlightening and eye opening in regards to developing innovative ideas.

97923,I love the way the course was structured and how Professor Liedtka taught the class. She has a lot of knowledge to pass which is so invaluable to today's organizations. This class provided a great intro to design thinking and how we need creativity and a more human centered approach in today's organizations. The only thing I wish we had was supplemental material to download to help enhance the learning experience.,4

83986,Dr. Chuck is great as usual.And some probles with autograder service.,4
78957,"It can be made more informative on theory side. The course is bit fast i guess or may be all the courses are like this only since this is my first course. But still i feel like things are going bit fast because I was not having any previous knowledge of data statistics or R language. However, giving some efforts on both sides I am happy with my performance. Thanks for the course.",3
1463,"The best algorithms course. The video lectures are very good. Prof.Sedgewick builds the concepts very well. The code examples/library written by Prof. Wayne and Prof. Sedgewick's code are very compact and the best I have seen. The online website is great supplement to the book. The auto grader is air tight, that forces the student to think and write their code to the specs. My greatest appreciations for Prof. Wayne and Prof. Sedgewick. I wish students have the option to submit their solutions in C++ because in most of the languages the core algorithms/data structures are often written in c/c++ , I understand it is not easy because the course libraries and grader has to written for c++.",5
62347,"I found this course really fascinating. The key concepts, academic insights, exercises and assignments; all contributed towards real world and practical learning experience.",4
19266,This is a very unevenly paced and constructed course - not at all delivered to the standard of the previous Coursera courses I have followed. Some lectures are clear and guide the learner step by step - and then others suddenly assume a level of knowledge and sophistication that is at a significantly higher level and includes concepts that have either not been introduced or have been dealt with in minimal detail. It also ends up focusing more on music analysis than music theory - while there is a relationship between these 2 approaches I did not embark on this course to become an analyst - as a practising musician I wanted to understand more of the concepts behind what I do and hear. Very disappointed - I will now look elsewhere to satisfy my learning.,2

104220,"Unlike the other two lecturers in this course, this module's lecture is very very bad. I always felt like coming back and learning more with the other two lectures but with this one I had to force myself to complete the lessons. First of all his English is bad, sometimes you cant understand what he means even with subtitles. He repeats many things through out the course and he tries to teach by asking questions all the time. As a guy who takes and make his own notes, I found it really difficult to put together a sentence he was saying. It seems that nobody proof read his lectures before posting it on coursera. I feel that it was done blindly and in a rushed way. If possible can you please change the videos and also the script. Please make it more understandable.",2

42423,"This course is very good. If the professor presents some slides to help me understand better, I will be glad.",5
57690,"Was a little too basic. Would have preferred more flesh (both implementational and mathematical) on the bones. I also found it absurd that each time the professor introduced a very basic linear algebra concept he kept saying somewhat patronizingly ""this is for the experts in linear algebra"". Come on! If one is taking a machine learning course, one can expect more from the students. Otherwise the course ends up being a flaky tap-dance on the surface of the material.",2

I am extremely honored to be taught by Prof him and HUJ. Highly recommended for students who have an interest in Neuroscience and need to begin with the fundmentals.,5
73491,"A very good course indeed. It explains with a good and simple way how the economy works at an individual level and at a business level. The major downside on the other hand, is that it is focused mainly in America. Non the less, it remains a very instructive and constructive course. Personally, i highly recommend it, to anyone, who wants to acquire some basic knowledge in microeconomics, or wants to see how economy works.",4

19931,"This course serves as a nice introduction to the field of computational neuroscience. However, at some points, more than basic knowledge of differential equations and probability & statistics is needed.",4
11978,"I do not recommend this course. It did not fill my expectations. I am not able to create application for mobile phone after finishing it.First 4 modules were somehow useful but since module 5 onward it is just waste of time, I did not learn anything useful, I did not learn how to code. Advices for sources were very shallow and it was not shown how to work with them. I could gain same information with basic search engine request.The teacher is nice and willing to give information to students. But unfortunatelly he did not prepare for recordings of videos. His speeches lacked structure and focus. Very often he was lost in talking and he often re-explained (in detail) staff which was already explained in previous videos. This caused that videos were too long considering the amount of knowledge that was provided to students and watching them was waste of time.The course was shallow, information did not go deep. Students participation was not supported (nor required) after 1 module.",1
99029,"You can learn a lot, but I do not think it is aimed at beginners.",5
8786,very low quality and not practical,1
15658,"Prof. Bloom was very interesting to watch and listen to. The course was well organized and free of technical issues, but it didn't seem quite as thorough a discussion of the topic as the plot course was. Very close to 5 stars.",4
6973,Overall a really good course. I learnt a lot about astronomy from this 4-week course.,5
52523,There was no engagement between the course instructors and students at all. It felt like students were running the whole show and discussion forums.,1

10182,"I found this course very interesting, and learnt a great deal about how and why the Bible came to be written.",5
56781,"Gently-paced and reasonable in terms of course work load, even for a busy person. This course greatly demystified machine learning for me.Alvin's lectures are friendly and easy to follow, and progress smoothly from one point of interest to the next, always taking time to briefly recap on precursor topics that were previously discussed.I really appreciate how the assignments focus on the core algorithms and their implementation. Ancillary implementation steps and a scaffolding for testing and viewing the results are already given for the learner to use, play with, and go back and reference for educational purposes if need be, for refreshing on use of tools such as plotting methods. The way the assignments are structured, putting emphasis on filling in the gaps with implementation of the important algorithms, makes completing assignments a very satisfying and fulfilling experience. I feared I would get caught up in preliminary steps, i.e. getting plots to display correctly or cleaning up the data, but that's all taken care of so that one can focus on practicing the techniques most relevant to the topic and algorithms.I only wish there were more assignments to complete, both to cover more of the course's material and to have more chances to practice algorithm prototyping in Octave/Matlab.",5
86255,Assistant Professor Mr. Franz Wohlgezogen you are the best. Thank you so much for your efforts to,5
40966,"I really liked that course! You should think about it as an introduction class, otherwise you will be really disappointed with its content. Speaking for my academic experience, I already know how to program a game, but I never had the chance to study the Game Design field. This course forced me to use a creatively thinking process to focus on some important aspects, like rules, multiplayer, and more.Do not take this class if: you are looking for academic resources, books references, lot of theory to study.Take this class if: you are looking for some challenges, with motivational contents, that can push you to express yourself with your own force and skills!Videos are also very fun to follow! I think that Frank is an awesome teacher, with great communication skills.",5

YA EN OCACIONES ANTERIORES QUE HE INTENTADO DESARROLLAR UNA APLICACION PARA ANDROID UTILIZANDO OTRAS HERRAMIENTAS PERO EXISTEN MUY POCA AYUDA O ME HAN PARECIDO MUY CONFUSAS LAS EXPLICACIONES QUE HE ECONTRADO. EN ESTE CURSO DE ANDROID LAS EXPLICACIONES ME HAN RESULTADO MUY CLARAS Y SENCILLAS.",5
15082,"This course is good to get all your programs set up before you start your studies in Data Science.I think it could offer a little bit deeper knowledge of git and github in order to guarantee it will not be a problem later, since they will not be strictly related to data science.",4
14104,Great insight to different types of data analytics and basics.,5
78878,D.T.,5
22160,"I think this is a great overview for beginners in the subject of personal finance management. It contains lots of useful information, references to websites for everyday use, practical examples and exercises to absorb the content and put it to action. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the subject matter is US centric so part of it (taxation for example) is not as relevant for those who live in other countries.",4
8243,I enjoyed this introductory course because it really provided the scope for this area of study and helped chart the course for the rest of the specialization as I move forward. Excited to move on through to the next course armed with what I have learned in this one!,4

4262,Course is very good! All examples are very clear and detailed. And a spreadsheet is provided to follow along during class. Only bad thing is that it was not so clear this course is heavily related to Math. Data Analysis = Math & Statistics. ;-),4
83816,"A very wonderful follow up to the first course in this specialization. Each topic is presented in a way that is clear to understand. Assignments increase slightly in difficulty, but are still very do-able. And the graduation ceremony at the end is a nice touch as well. Overall, very satisfied with this specialization so far.

62961,"I was not impressed. (And not impressed with this automatically centered text box either.) There was far too much very technical detail that no one save those working for hedge fund developers would ever use. The volume of analysis they suggest is overwhelming and impossible for the average investor, and when all is said and done, worthless. The market moves on news, rumors, scandal, etc; think Enron, Worldcom, Texaco, et al. None of the concepts presented in this course would have prevented you from investing in those companies when they were beginning or in their prime.I'm about to become a registered investment advisor. I took this course looking for ideas to improve my recommendations. No go. This was terrible.In addition, the presentation was presented by automatons I think. They rarely looked at us, they read flatly from the prompter. A good text to speech program could easily have replaced the ""teachers"".",1

47796,"At 51 years old I have learned there is much more to learning, more of an efficient skill and methodology , than a drawn out complex process. Thank you, Charles.",4
12084,The course and the teachers are amazing. I learned a lot of new things about the Blockchain technology and I also learned many things from the assignments. You should include more assignments in the future. It would be very constructive if you can create some suggestive diagrams in the assignments and if you can present the results for some simple test cases.,5

9756,"The course assumes no prior knowledge of calculus. The video lectures and explanations provided by Professor Jim Fowler on all of the topics in the course are excellent. There is quite a lot of work in the course overall, and it does require some perseverance to get through it. However, it does allow you to work at your own pace which is a welcome feature for a beginning learner in calculus. As well as providing a thorough explanation of the usual processes involved in differentiation and integration, the course shows many techniques that are not well explained in text books. From a personal perspective, the course took me about 6 months to complete and I learnt a lot by doing it. Many thanks to Professor Fowler for his teaching and insights into calculus.",5
85231,"Dr. Chuck is the most encouraging and entertaining teacher I have ever met!!! He really makes learning about computer and programming easy and fun! I really enjoyed his lectures and I cannot believe learning programming can be such a pleasure!Most importantly, Dr. Chuck intentionally included many mistakes in his teaching materials. As a self-taught programmer who has struggled on one's own, I believe this is the most valuable part of the lectures. The students get to understand from the very beginning how to read error messages and tracebacks, how to debug, how not to be intimidated by mistakes and failures, and how to become a confident programmer. This should be THE teaching model for programming in any language!Thank you, Dr. Chuck! And I look forward to learning more from you in our follow-up courses!",5

76692,"I've tried the Python course of Rice university, and some part of the Codecademy Python course! This is much more basic and offer a fundamental view about all programming language not only just python. Compared to the Rice University course, this one is more for a new beginner who hasn't done any coding before. The Rice course doesn't really need any coding exp, but with the projects get more complicated in the end, it would be much easier if you have somewhat coding exp before, at least in my opinion.Anyway, I can't wait for all this specialization of University of Michigan!",5

4315,"The concepts here are useful and Mr. Egger is a knowledgeable instructor but 1) this class is really about gathering information with Excel as the tool - you aren't learning anything about Excel functionality, so the title of this course is really misleading if you just want to become a stronger user in Excel 2) there is a huge disconnect between the video lessons and the excel worksheets used to complete the assignments and since many previous reviewers mentioned this, it seems like that's not going to change. 3) the disconnect between the lessons and the assignments wouldn't be an issue if the instructor could be bothered to respond to forum questions. Mine sat unanswered for 5 days as the deadline passed. You are NOT going to get support if you dont understand something.",1
55065,I have taken the non-certification course of Machine Leaning by Dr. Andrew Ng. The material covered is this course is adequate and very insightful. In my opinion this course should be a start point for any individual who want to learn Machine Learning.

78933,"Presentation of the content, course slides and labs are best from what I've seen on Coursera. The only downside was that to my feeling the final project and the course content are somehow disconnected. The course itself deals with introduction to probability, while final project is EDA. I don't think there was enough materials on EDA in the course, so the final project took more effort and was confusing at first.",4
44551,Fantastic course for an undergraduate like me. Not only for this undergraduate but also for the one's who like to enhance their learning ability better than before in any field. The age is not the constrain to understand the course material.,5

83107,"Content is good, less well polished than Odersky's courses though.

The professors are very enthusiastic and creative: they explain difficult subjects very clearly and provide visual aids and in-video quizes to enhance more deep understanding of material.Special thanks for the project assignments! They are very interesting and well-laid.I would recommend this course to programmers who want to deepen and practice their data-structures skills. For the novices this course should be taken after the first course of the specialization.,5

56740,"Great course, good overview over the most interesting topics of machine learning with the possibility to try them out with your own code.Easy to use submission system (both Octave and MATLAB worked fine).Minor drawback: an overview of more advanced/complex implementations of the concepts shown would be helpful for deciding where to go next after this course. Still, 5 Stars, because the course covers the important algorithms well enough to understand and use them, within very short videos.",5
106317,"The course was simply amazing. I am a Brazilian student of veterinary medicine with an special interst in birds. I love to watch and learn about them, and, if possible, I will work with the medicine and rehab of that incredible group of living dinosaurs. The course was extremely didactic and clear on all past information, making my interest only increase. Unfortunately I can not afford to buy the certificate, which makes me sad in a way.

1821,very informative and great lecture :),5

We call ourselves superior evolved organisms but one chemical group can turn us off... some organism, a virus which is not even as big as two lines of our fingerprint can kill us... I wonder if we are manipulating nature or nature is manipulating us in greater speed...I also wonder we should have stone inscriptions of our findings that can stay centuries later to tell the world of the future, our stories than software and hardware which might not stand strong against calamities...overwhelmed, humbled by all the information...",5
30385,it is very useful for learning english.,5
843,This course has a lot of tools to learn the writing art.,5
67149,Prof Hinton shares all his knowledge in designing an award-winning neural network. This is less a hands-on course but is more a very profound teaching of deep learning theory. If you can understand everything that is taught in this course then you will be the next genius that comes up with the next bleeding edge neural nets. That's not for me though as I struggled from week to week till the end but I learned a lot. Many thanks to Prof Hinton for generously sharing his knowledge and insights in this topic.,5

90066,Love it,5
24357,"The course in general is fine. Although it is not an introductory level, and users should be aware of it. By the time you finish it, you will have an idea of how financial engineering works and will understand the math behind the scenes. The required level of mathematics is not very high, and high-school maths are enough to follow the formalism. Also, several assignments are done in Excel, so basic knowledge of its features will help.",4
73519,"This is the first course I've ever taken in an economics subject and it was a great introduction to the field. The presentations and delivery are clear and illustrative, and the different concepts are reinforced throughout the different modules. Dr Navarro explains difficult and complex information in a way that makes it easy for a beginner like myself to understand, relating it to real life examples, and drawing on key historical events and figures. I'm greatly looking forward to starting The Power of Macroeconomics with UCI and would highly recommend these courses to anyone interested in the subject.",5

102553,"This course is a wonderful nexus between east and west, between science and religion, between intuition and reason and between all those dichotomies, the false ones and more! It is just a shame that discussion forum moderators have become petty tyrants given censorship powers. At least, that was how it was last time I was bothered enough to try to get this stuff. One star subtracted, but it should be more given discussion is the only way really to do philosophy. Only one will do though because I guess it is a systemic problem and that it probably doesn't affect those of you who aren't borderline trolls who imbeciles easily mistake for the bad kind.",4

98332,"I found much of the content to be interesting and timely. However, I thought the quizzes were poorly written. There was no feedback, so as a learner it was hard to grow from errors. Also, there were many that required more than one answer, if you missed one, you missed entire question. Without feedback, it was difficult to know which one you missed. The week 4 lesson content was a bit dense for an introductory course. It was dry and could've been more global. Last, the large lesson assignment was only graded by peers with no feedback from the instructor.",2
14423,Great course! well paced and timing appropriate. Quizes reflected taught lessons.,4

Roger has done a very good job explaining the concepts. I certainly would recommend this course to all who's interested in the subject.I realize that there's limitation on the time people suppose to spend each week, however, I would like to suggest adding homework, in addition to quizzes.Several video clips have some audio issues, not sure if that's fixable.",4

31934,"Good, concise course.The reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because I found it difficult (not impossible) to follow some of professor Eyal Naveh speach. His first language is not English, so I do not expect him to speak perfect English. However, I would expect the subtitles/transcript not to have basic mistakes. This became important when professor Naveb interview another person in Hebrew, as I found I could not really trust the subtitles.I think it wouldn't take much to make it an excellent course.My cheeky suggestion is to have a specialisation with The Emergence of the Modern Middle East by Professor Asher Susser as nucleus and a series of shorter, more in depth courses on certain of the bigger countries, such as Egypt, Turkey and Iran, similar to this one on Israel.",3

98958,Great follow up course on Ruby programming!,5
61906,"With consistent effort, I have found this course to re-ignite my passion for mathematics. Keith Devlin, the instructor, does an excellent job of helping us to develop our ability to think in mathematical and logical ways. In short, I have found a new joy and excitement for doing mathematics, even stuff I consider hard. I have a new-found passion and new ""eyes"" for maths that I didn't have before.

13184,I really really enjoy the teaching. The professor explains concepts in a clear and concise fashion. The quizs are useful too in helping me consolidating and realising the gaps in my knowledge. Game theory is now one of my favourite themes in Economics.,5
40537,"Fabulous overview of the science of global warming! I really appreciated the step-by-step approach and the comprehensive coverage of the subject. Playing with the models was highly useful in most cases, though some of the quiz questions related to the models seemed to be overly finicky in the answers they'd accept as correct. In any case, I thoroughly enjoyed this course and will be using the knowledge I gained from it as I begin pursuing a Master's in environmental science this summer.",5

69253,This course is a sequence of sales pitches by Hlavac's relations. The continuous invitation to purchase a course where companies advertise their products is a shame and lacks in depth material.

80952,World class teacher. Fine contents with a very useful legal approach that is often missed in introductory negotiation courses.Compared to other Coursera MOOCs I missed support materials or further readings. Additional assignments and cases could be included.,4
78901,"The course was well-structured and the instructor clearly illustrated statistical concepts to students who have no prior experience in the field. Although the lab assignment for each week may seem a bit stressful for beginners, the overall learning is highly inspiring and does prove rewarding as students finally get to apply the technical skills to their final project. Also, the guidance for each lab assignment was very helpful. It would be even better if there are example code answers for the lab questions, since some of the questions are a bit more complicated. Overall, this is a worth-taking course.",5
79464,"As a software engineer, materials related to social medias and its privacy issues are not new at all. However, basic principals and practices on the personal branding are very helpful.

481,"It was fun. Have peer review is helpful. However, it was mainly one time comment. It would be great to start conversation and interaction among course takers.",4
14671,"Great introduction. The lessons were clear and easy to follow. Github is a new tool. I used to be shy about using Github because I didn't understand all the commands, but I'm confident I'll pick it up easily during the rest of the course. I already feel more comfortable with it.I'm a mechanical engineer, so this is a different way of thinking for me. I was amused by the lesson on what data is and about the kinds of data analysis because the data I look at always comes a CSV file / Excel file, and I only do mechanistic analysis. So I'm looking forward to expanding my definition of data and analysis.",5
3761,GOOD place to start THe arduino intro is good but little short on c but its only 4 weeks not enough for me to grasp right off the bat anyway so i back off to next session then catch up more C then finish its only a couple short c videos then your asked to write programs with little or no knowledge basicly 3- 7 min lectures on the language EASY TO BE KINDA LOST AT FIRST IM 60 yrs old not twenty !!! From what im reading online LIBRARIES ARE TOTALLY LIMITED ON ARDUINOS IDE nd ITS NOT REALLY C its ARDUINO C because a lot of the workings of the arduino ide are easier for new people alot of the inner workings are hidden tough to learn the inner workings unlike a full featured IDE GOOD Platform to start on AFTER BASICS HERE with tidbits Id rather go later to C++ and spend the time there then get on better platform ARM PIC boards with real ides and REAL C + something you can use in the real world for bigger programs and I can see staying here at arduino too long and not going on to other platforms could cause bad programing habits to start with writing limited code just seems more productive after you get your electronics down coding and some hardwhare experience to go right to the real deal Pic arm or any of the other boards with a MUCH steeper learning curve GREAT to Figure out and learn electronics get some hardwhare experience here of course on ARDUINO and from what im seeing from some pros Even if there on more advanced platforms that run bigger faster programs dont have the bootloader many pros use arduino for a first layout to test circuits here first GOOD COURSE gets you DIGGING AND THINKING This is where to start you certainly cant start on advanced platforms right off its really almost impossible without a lot more skill to obtain first,5

41103,"Very good course, though it is an introduction, I feel as though I already knew most of the subjects that were explained, however I did not know the impact that those could have on a game's value and how it helps the player engage in the game.

62851,Really good.,5
22286,"Thanks for creating short course for busy business pearson.But, it is too gamificate to (professional business managers) educate.

2241,"great course. great example databases. i would suggest renaming the course Managing Big Data with MySQL and TeraData.

83112,"Force students to develop the assignment code by TDD, which is very good. All the assignments are not just toy problems, which is excellent as well. If you want to learn some parallel programming algorithms, you do choose this course. The drawbacks may be that some of the concepts or expression in the lectures are obscured. Although the assignments cover almost all the important algorithms and data structures, like UpSweep, DownSweep, reducing tree and combiners, the exercises on these things are not enough.",5

23512,"Super interesting, but it is a very basic introduction to nutrition. Only the first or second lessons have information about nutrients and how they are different from each other. The other sections you could've gotten from a Michael Pollan book, or one of his documentaries.

37594,"Excellent course, the only thing that prevented me from giving 5-starts is that it would be extremely helpful if we received feedback from the host school. Given the nature of Coursera, I know this is unfeasible, but it would still be nice. Otherwise, it's ""the blind leading the bind"" scenario. Given all that, I'd still recommend this course to anyone without reservation.",4

17399,very interesting and useful information. A bit challenging for me to use the tools as I was not familiar with the software,5
88784,Actually I have enjoyed the course . I have learned about the problems were asked by previous philosophers and about how to think correctly by analyzing the prefaces to get logical results .,5
9072,"The course is clear, informative and yet not very hard. Jim Fowler is crazy looking but he's very engaging, you want to share his craziness about calculus, and by the end of the course I found myself enjoying when new approaches come from previously learned.The only one slight minus for me was, that there is no medium complexity ""homeworks"". Tests and exercises are sometimes too easy and repetitive. On the other side challenges given in lectures are too hard, and has no answers to check yourself .",5

56413,"This course has absolutely made me a confident ML practitioner. I went from knowing very little about a few ML algorithms to being able to confidently implement many of them, and easily learn to implement others from outside resources. Beyond having mastered the algorithms themselves, I now feel equipped to effectively diagnose and debug problems in my own ML projects.I have learned to plot the learning curves in order to find the most effective way to improve my algorithm, and I have used this in real life already! It's a very empowering feeling. Machine Learning used to feel like magic, but now it's a clear and simple tool to add to my toolbelt.Thank you so much Professor Ng for a marvelous course! I learned so much, it feels like I'm in college. Thanks!!!",5

100640,Too much focus on portfolio investments topic. Would expect more on modeling principles in broader context.,2
93783,"Pro: The course covers a lot of information and the necessary reference material to do the assignmentsCons: 1) This is definitely NOT a beginners course with no background with R. The assignments cover/test things that are not covered in class. Please don't advertise this to be a ""no experience required"" class. 2) The code that is presented in the lessons is overwhelming (read: daunting) to someone like me (with no experience). So it doesn't help when the instructor talks through the code. Please look at datacamp tutorials - If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have passed this class.",4

102816,great and succinct course,5
104843,"This course means well but the lectures in the first half of the course are not good. The instructor seems to take a midway between rigorous mathematics, using terms like robust etc while at the same time also trying to keep it easily accessible. RD Peng's courses take a much better approach in that they keep things at one end of the spectrum (simple language). Having a background in theoretical physics and computer science, this duality in this course is very confusing for me. Also, I do not need to see a tiny, grainy video inset of the instructor during the lecture videos.",2

70056,it will be great if there is another course from the same team.thanks for nice way of teaching,5
13580,"The depth and explanation of theoretical concepts are better than the first course. I like the in depth discussion over various introduced data structures, for instance there are comparisons between naive implementations vs smarter implementations. However overall the topic is very theoretical, maybe add a little more connection of each introduced data structure with respect to its application would make the topic less dry and more motivating.",3
100260,good enough for saving and managing my time,4
36201,Complete course with a valid Professor. Thank You Yale and thank You Coursera,5
41296,"A very very good introduction to Inferential Statistics. A very systematic review of this topic.I like very much the videos they did, very lively. This is a proof that they have put a lot of efforts on it.The teachers also give very important remarks to lead us think in the good way.",5

47115,"I really enjoyed this course and found it to be very helpful. A lot of the information was common sense, but the science behind the rationale was very interesting and useful in learning anything new.

51641,I love this course. I look forward to part 2.,5
69206,Offered helpful and practical advice about how to use blogs to engage and retain your target market.,5
16702,"The specialization is great, and the course breadth and topics described in each is equally good. For this course, however, I felt like I could have covered what was taught by myself with a book, i.e. I didn't feel like it was class room level engaging with the explanations.I realized this is a one way MOOC, but I've taken courses off and on since they came out, and some others felt more interactive. This was more of here's a slide, I will read what's on the slide and explain some topics. The assignments were not bad, but definitely took more time than stated (just keep that in mind). The other thing that would help immensely is having TAs in the course. It's possible that they may get some later, but I've felt I learned/got feedback a lot more in courses with TAs.That said, this is an excellent introduction to databases course, and there's not many of them out there. If I had to go it again, I would, and I also paid for getting the cert - if anything for career advancement and having it on your LinkedIn profile as a starter DB course.",3
101572,"I really enjoy screenwriting and this course has not only gave me some interesting points but also, help me develop my own tv show idea and start writing it. It's really good so far!",5
10444,"Course is very basic , although contents are compact and informative.",3
58348,A very friendly course which digs very deep into the core Mathematics behind Machine Learning.

91342,it's amazing and more helpful for improving communication skills,4
48033,very helpful ! professors are also very great and they must prepare a lot for this course!,5
19616,Not very well put together. It marked some answers as wrong that were actually correct.,1
16698,Step by step explanations. Divided into small parts so that the students can digest the information in small pieces. I like it so far.,4

9832,So fresh...,5
24647,"A serious, attractive and well done MOOC. Big thanks to Mr Curry and his whole team for sharing knowledges in Paleonthology with people interested in. I really enjoyed learning those courses, which deal with many topics, give the basics and more about new discoveries. Best whishes !",5
16003,I am very happy for joined this course and now that is over I can say I miss it!The weekly assignments were really useful and I know they'll still be useful for my daily activities. Thank you all for that!,5
99560,Learnt very good tricks about placement of objects. Missed some design patterns or game specific algorithms.,4
76557,its awesome programming language.,5
93127,"Some of the material was not useful in completing the assignments. Profiling was not useful in this regard. While it is useful in the real world, it was unrelated to the assignments. Also, Better examples of functions like lapply, tapply etc. besides using random data would be more likely to make sense what the function is doing. Also, there are references to statistics/statistical methods that the student may have no background in. This is also not helpful for explaining the material. The video content is largely just reading the text of the slides. It takes much more time to watch the reading of the slides than just to read them. This is not the best use of video. Neither is watching the instructor sitting in his office talking. It would be better to see a concrete problem solved, and explain why the steps taken are used. The problem could be related to the assignments but different enough to not be copied. I had to rely heavily on online resources and help files to get answers to things I think should have been part of the course material, as this is an introductory class.",3
4791,Very usefull course. Good explanation about the disease and actual course.,4

44736,Totally helpful! Thanks to this project I do my school duty much better. Thank you Barbara :-) Thanks from Czech republic.Bc. et Bc. Pavla MutinskÃ¡.,5
58495,Much more interactive than I expected. Pace is a bit fast especially if you are doing this with a day job but still great to follow and learn.,5
66138,"Its a good course for any one who wants to go into politics, business or religion. Only thing i did not like was there was not too much teacher student interaction.",4
41285,It's too diffult for some of the questions in the Quiz. Have no idea or support to solve them.,3
69924,I really like this course. I took the previous one and it helped me so much! I really love how you all teach. Please do bring a level 2 or something. Amazing work!! Hwaiting!,4
77539,"Teacher Charles is doing a wonderful job to me, a very beginning learner. I've never thought I could take a programming class, and I didn't know if I can do that.

34810,"I really enjoyed this course, it gives you a clear introduction on GIS, and allows you to further your knowledge in other courses.",5
66545,"This course takes an alternate approach to understanding modern Art, moving it away from categories based on the time period in which art was made or what school the artist was part of and instead groups art work by theme. I really enjoyed all the pieces I encountered and felt like I had a somewhat better understanding of modern art after taking this course.",3
42010,Really helpful. One thing: the videos in Youtube werenÂ´t able to watch,5
31566,Great resources. I am already using these ideas in my language classes. A great resouce to keep coming to time and time again.,5

15861,Great introductory course,5
49991,"i thoroughly enjoyed this course though i am new to programming ,This course has not only helped me learn python fundamentals but laid a good foundation to develop programmatic thinking.",4
75082,"A really nice, gentle introduction to the basics of the Python language. I was already familiar with much of it from previous endeavours at learning to code, so managed to get through each week in about an evening's work, but it didn't 'feel right' to jump into the second course straight away. The last programming assignment caused a little bit of head scratching, and re-highlighted the need for careful, precise thinking when writing even short pieces of code. I've enjoyed this course and will be back for the Data Structures module soon :)",5
65698,Awesome Neh!!!!!,5
82195,Great lesson! Thanks for making this lesson happen.Concise and informative. Some pop up quizzes really help learners get the gist of the lessons. I may recommend that there should be a table to compare the different memos so that we can memorize the differences more easily.,5
52168,"Another great class in this specialization. I recommend these courses to all educators, regardless of the subject you teach. It will help you teach your subject better, and also help you better understand language teaching so you can be more understanding of, and helpful to, your English language learners.",5
92168,"This course was really nice one. I am expecting more courses on ""Using Databases with Python and data analytics""",5
87569,"Everything good explained, even if u would be a beginner. Earlier it took me much time to learn these concepts from different sources in web. Dr Chuck explaines this all (call webservises per APIs, JSON, XML, XML schemes etc) in a very vivid manner in this collection of videos. Recommendable.",5
37000,"I would say it was very quick over-viewed and extremely informative course! However, I would recommend not to stop on this and look up for more on HTML, CSS and JS.",4
70121,"It's a lot of fun to study this course, especially the peer review could be very rewarding and entertaining.",5
52294,"This course was very helpful. There were many tips and hints and practical suggestions on how to design a lesson in the course. It was exactly what I needed to learn. Though we all had a lot of fun, it took me quite a lot of energy and mental efforts to complete all the assignments. Good job, guys!",5
58956,"Great explanations, well-paced, effective assignments, and a likeable instructor (Andrew Ng)!",5
62606,Great first course! Everything is very interesting!,5
97515,An interesting course. Could do with a bit of a technical overhaul as it feels a little clunky in terms of access to course materials and technical structure. Overall well presented and excellent content.,3

24433,good learning with explanation on basic financials,3
10179,It is great! This helped me to develope my skills about science,5
95022,"Very difficult if you are unfamiliar with python, but achievable. Assignments can be frustrating to get just right for the autograder, but you learn important subtleties in the meantime. Cannot wait to complete the rest of the courses in this specialization!!",5
5433,"Overall this course was great but I wish that the timeline was a little clearer from the get-go. I had to rush at the end because I didn't realize week 2 was for finding sources, week 3 was for contacting them, week 4 was for interviews, etc...If the MSU staff could have given their feedback on our final projects, that would have been another plus, but I know it's difficult with so many students.",4
25918,"I'm not done yet, but this course is amazing.The instructions are well presented, the teacher paces the class properly and I'm actually learning useful information that will help me on my journey to become a 3D developer!Thank you!",5

774,"it is well put and easy to understand. besides, you can learn it anytime. the content is enlightening and has many new and intestesting topics. i really like it .",5
94965,"Lots of value in the course. If the tutors didn't read from their notes, but instead would speak freely into the camera, it would be even more engaging and personal.",4
103125,"The best thing about the course was the acknowledgment that this is a highly interdisciplinary area and the emphasis on future research directions. The topics are covered by providing plenty of background explanation, though I found the repetition way too much at times. I would have liked to see the English in the slides, transcription of the videos, and most importantly, in the quizzes, proofread - at times, the seemingly small errors made it hard to understand what the quiz questions were about. A good introductory course all around. Thanks for your efforts!",4
99914,Very useful suggestions for time management - to the point and effective! You can use the strategies right away. Thank you for this!,5
5807,"Really enjoyable, and a good learning curve",5
6206,A nice course to introduce Bioconductor to students,4
95435,"It's a good course over all. There is only one thing that I would like to suggest, which is that the autrograder does not seem to work well. It really wasted me lots of time to get the RIGHT ANSWER understood by the autograder.",4

77256,"This course is an eye opener, a must take for everyone",5
36685,"Excellent material! I thought the lectures were very well organized and expertly presented, and my interest was kept up throughout the course. The only thing I would like to see is some more challenging homework/quizzes to help drive home the content. I came in as a financial markets newbie (I'm a computer engineer by trade), and my interest is definitely piqued to learn more. Thanks, Prof. Shiller!",4
14796,There were lectures about how to install R and RStudio on Mac and Windows. And the quiz asked about information on these lectures. You must pay attention to them even if you have previously installed them.,4
21717,Terrible englishQuite diffuse contentNo reading texts,1
60292,nice and easy to understand what the main purpose of machine learningï¼,5
2483,good course for tableau and effective communication.,4
34561,This is an excellent MOOC. I am a PhD candidate studying human intelligence and spatial cognition specifically associated with problem solving. The content is very well structured and clearly communicated through the lectures. Having been briefly introduced to some of the concepts in my own studies prior to this course I am finding the difficulty level to be quite nice (challenging yet very manageable). The inclusion of various experiments throughout the course is a good idea as it makes it all very interesting.,5
29133,Great view into dog emotion and cognition! Fantastic for helping learn the psychological side of training!,5
14165,I've learned lots of new things,5
7676,"We don't have children, but I really enjoyed taking this online course on child nutrition and cooking offered by Stanford.

Some of this take away might seem obvious for some people, but it's good to absorb them from an expert in the area!Some of the videos still need edition as they invite you to watch a video which is not embedded in the video, then the teacher starts talking about the video.....To enhance the course, I would recommend to correct the above and perhaps inviting other experts for some interviews to show to the audience.",4
37229,excellent course for web developers.Great lecture notes.,5
92115,"Amazing class, I cannot have enough of this professor, very very good",5
12620,"Pedagogically insurmountable! I recommend it! I am a PhD student writing the thesis, and need to refresh old subjects. Well, this was better than any math course I took in the University.

651,"Great Course, Learnt alot of extremely useful tools for managing software products.",5
63856,"(1) lectures and example codes are good(2) assignments have some good questions that make student to become familiar with topics(3) some assignment problems are not clear. It is hard to even understand what the question asks. You don't know what to do until you have found a discussion post that a tutor explains what the question is. It will be helpful if the assignment could use more narratives and figures to make the questions clear to student.(4) Some later assignments are hard and may requires more thinking.(5) It is recommended to have an extra week/lectures videos on Object Oriented Programming. This topic can be optional/not for grades if it is too advanced for some students. However, it is good to have this topic covered in this course, as your lecture explanations are good and assignment questions are the best and optimal way for us to quickly master a topic.",5
70756,"Although I agree that the mapping library that is used for the programming assignments adds something visually interesting to the course, I felt that it added an unnecessary level complexity when it came understanding the object-oriented aspects of the language. I spent a lot of time trying to understand how to use a library that I won't likely use again just to be able to apply the core programming concepts being taught in that lesson. Having said this, I felt a good sense of accomplishment after getting through the final project.",4

28461,Thank you for the class. It was really insightful.,5
105796,"Speechless,! I'll simply quote another reviewer who spelt it out in one short sentence "" This is simply the best course you can ever take on coursera"". Professor Sachs provided answers I have been looking for but couldn't find in countless areas. It would have been a shame if I lived through this life without ever discovering this astounding course.",5
33938,I found the course videos quite dull and uninteresting. The topics covered could have been taught a lot better. I finished this course only because I wanted to get through the specialization course. I found that the course 'Fundamentals of Graphic Design' did an exponentially better job of explaining image making techniques and composition. The assignments in this course are reasonably good but the instruction videos can definitely benefit from some additional in-depth material.,2

72634,"I've spent a bit of time going through the Specialisation (paid for one course here) and other courses online that offer Machine Learning with Python. I looked at books too. I've come to the conclusion that it's unforgivable to teach it using graphlab (that you have to pay for after free licence expiry) when everyone else teaches scikit learn (sklearn) for good reason.The tools used on this course are also not very good.Everyone else teaches using text editors - for a good reason, you learn how to code properly.The lessons are also dry and there are far too many of them.",1
69010,"A phenomenal, deliberately shallow introduction to Machine Learning. This course definitely cannot standalone but serves as a great start to the specialization.There was a great deal of sensitivity in the course due to the use of Dato Graphlab, particularly since one of the instructors is the CEO of Dato and the software is not free for commercial use. This was exacerbated because the color scheme of the presentation slides matches the color scheme of the Dato website.However putting this aside the material is very high quality. The use of case studies is inspired and helps students focus on when to use particular ML techniques. Although the material is a little shallow (deliberately) you get a good high-level feel for what techniques are applicable in specific situations. However the course can't really standalone, and it's intended as part of the specialization.",4

25415,"It was a good course overall, but some of the material was very complex and would require more than 3 weeks of study.

95465,"Course teaches Python Pandas in a very practical way and I'm sure now having learnt it I'll use the skill. But this course wasn't taught well. Weekly assignments asked questions about skills that had not been taught yet. The course coordinators didn't respond or help in the forums, The topic area deserves more in depth video lectures and discussion. All the above basically means that passing the weekly assignments takes longer than you may assume. Had the course been taught and tested more effectively then doing the weekly assignments would less frustrating and time consuming.Basically the course is good, but it requires much more work and research because of the poor way its caught and monitored by staff.",2

10158,"The course teaches a lot of core concepts of distributed systems (clouds included). The content is well delivered and the homework reflects the material very well. The homework is appropriately tough.There is an optional programming assignment for setting up a distributed network of nodes with failure detection. I learned a lot about gossip based information spreading while doing the exercise. That said, the assignment is not clearly explained and it is hard to get started.Overall I did enjoy the course and learned a great deal.",5

89127,The last homework si quite a difficult spike. Way too complicated for beginners.,1

69701,"The course is a very practical approach to the language. The main goal of it being to help you get by in the country. It's title should be Surviving in China 101. Although misleading for people wanting to learn the language to an extensive level, it's definitely a good base to have and to build on. The material is presented in a very accessible manner and the quizzes help you master the key elements acquired within each session. Overall, great class if you plan visiting the country and want to be able to get by without a translator as we all know that not all Chinese natives speak English.",4

101875,Some amazing techniques and hands on course. A must for all.,5
47954,"I thought I would finish this self-paced course in a couple of days, but my 30 second summary of the first week's materials was that learning takes time. So I took the full 4 weeks to complete this course. This course doesn't reveal some new and amazing technique that enabled me to become a walking encyclopedia overnight. In fact I had already heard of all of the techniques. For example, I've tried 30 second summaries before, but I wasn't good at it right away, so I decided the technique didn't work for me. This time I treated the techniques as something I would have to spend time learning how to do, just like any other skill. Because the course became about learning new skills, I really enjoyed it. If I'd just done what I'd always done (take notes and memorize them), then I would have been bored witless, struggled with motivation and procrastination, and dropped out.",5
89826,Good practice. Straight forward information.,5

Two weeks into the lesson and I have never been bored - it is interesting and engaging.,5
88647,Thank you so much.,5
73172,I'm learning a lot in this class. I actually decided it was worth paying for. Thanks for making it $49 instead of $79. I think the videos are really helpful for explaining confusing concepts.

I tested different computers, windows and mac operating systems, different browsers, different security settings, etc. Nothing works. The assignment is also way beyond the level of an introductory course. In addition, the complete lack of discussion forums attached to the course suggests that it is preferable to shut off discussion than to address the problems. Speaking of which, a search of the general forums indicate that this has been an ongoing issue since the latter half of 2015. Seriously, what the hell? Many people don't have a ton of extra money to throw away on garbage, and you are selling a defective product.",1

15257,"Dry videos. Most classes are someone showing how they do something their way, rather than guiding or teaching with the intent to have the student absorb and re-apply principles.Very difficult for a student to absorb material from this video series",2
87445,"Wonderful lectures, excellent teacher, nice assignments, however bit too easy.",4
90315,"I dont like how this course was presented. The professors are good but the way how they present the course is extremely inefficient. I mean, because the instructor only speaks moving hands from one side to other, it was very difficult to visualize what and where the instructor was referencing to. Eg. a figure with 3 formulas and many variables there was no way to know in what alpha variable in formulas the instructor was talking about, once all formulas had the alpha variable. Also, when trying to describe a 3D environment only moving hands, its quite impossible to determine what and where the instructor is. One suggestion to try to minimize this problem would be try to use a lase pointer or a stick or a pen or something similar to help the student to now where the instructor exactly is. One example of good presentation is the course of ML from Andrew Ng where he writes all the things while speaking which facilitates the student to follow the sequence. Hope this can help.",3

72431,"The overall course is very well organised and coherent with the previous one. Lectures are clear and interesting, sometimes a little bit too slow but I do suggest to put them in 1.5x in those cases. Little by little you will be given more independence and autonomy in exercises, and this is done in a smooth and very intelligent way. I also appreciated that there were many exercises with numpy and less importance has been given to graphlab. It is always better when students are learning on tools which are completely open source (and also more popular on the market) !",5
83223,"IIts original,very insightful,and educative,above all content is evidence",5
92974,"Wonderful course, it forced me to depend on myself. I had to search, I had to read and go through lots of articles, questions, solutions and tutorials online and also, in the discussion board to solve the assignments. I believe it is the best way for someone to get knee deep and learn the language. This is exactly the methodology that should be followed in the real world. One would have to search and find solutions for any issues that are encountered. I enjoyed it and moving on to completing the specialization.",5

90921,"Great course. Initiate you to review much of your math and engineering control knowledge by specific problems. This is more of an application course, you see the application, the math behind and use Matlab to program certain situation. Beware, it's a one month course so they don't spend time to walk you through the basic math, some specific terms are explained during the lecture but not all, a reference for some Control book maybe needed to know what are those terms.If you have no knowledge in these area, some supplemental material maybe provided but be ready to learn and explore more on your own.",5

Thank you Bocconi and Professor Stefano Caselli for the great learnings",5
63938,"The course is very good for intermediate level people. Highly recommended for the people who is like me who thinks they know basics in matlab, but I can bet your will be stunned how many thing works which you didn't know previously. The last three assignments are horrible. I've spend at least full 4 days to complete them. But overall good experience. Recommended for people who know little bit matlab but wants to dig more.",5

20528,"I would advise anyone doing this specialization, to take the Java for Android first, then do the Engineering Maintainable Android apps, as its only in the Engineering Maintainable Android apps that there is an optional coursework to create and test a very simple app for the first time. All the other MOOCs optional courseworks start from very complex pre-existing app examples. I was able to complete these courseworks but I didnt really understand all the surrounding code that did a lot of important UI stuff, or the JUnit test. Its good to be forced to make a simple app and get used to JUnit from day 1. I did not take this route, but I wish I had.",4

18475,"HTML, CSS and JS materials were covered and were made easy to understand. CodePen and the Write Your Own websites cooperate great with the course. The quizzes are simple while I found he coding practice challenging and yet not too difficult.My only concern is whether the materials covered would help to build a realistic website, say, the homepage of Facebook or Google. It seems though I've finished the course, I still have no idea of how those webpages I see everyday works, let alone code them myself. The following courses in this series focus on Java, so ...By the way, spending 2-3 hours for a week to finish it as soon may help against forgetting. HTML, CSS and JS seem disconnected before you make them cooperate. Cheers!",4
52245,"This is an outstanding introduction to lesson planning. It covers the subject in far more detail than did my graduate teaching course. I would have given 5 stars but still struggle a bit with the presentational style of the instructor. Don't let this put you off though as that is very much a personal opinion and the material is excellent. For those who have followed the earlier courses in the specialization, I should warn that this one is much more difficult, particularly for those without prior teaching experience, and far more practically based.",4

16896,"That course was going to drive me mad but it's one of the most useful parts of the specialization. I already know where to use it in my job as most people listen to numbers more. I think that the problems that appeared in the process of calculating the results are some bugs in R and have nothing to do with the design of the course. Good job, Jacob and Scott! You're great, guys!",5
55219,"The learning material is so detailed it's worth the course by itself, prof. Ng does not get caught up in needless details, he gets straight to the point and you can go after the math later. It's the perfect course. Thank you Coursera for a incredible learning experience.",5

Hence, I do not consider this course as an introduction course on neural networks. I will not recommend this course to anyone who is just started learning about neural networks. However I do indeed recommend this course to anyone who would love to have a deep understanding of neural networks, and already has the basic understanding of neural networks and RBMs. If you've never used a neural network, never heard of backpropagation, or never got the basic understanding of RBMs, then this is not the course for you. If you a passionate about neural networks, have used them earlier, and what to get a deep understanding, this is indeed the course for you. I consider this a Ph.D level course.

15134,The course is very simple,2
24231,"The course is well made. Unfortunately, you will find at least one, minor or fatal, error in every video as well as quizzes.

101650,"I don't know what happened but it seems they had technical or some other problem while preparing this course. Some assignments were more oriented to solving marginal problems then using Spark and distributed and parallel computing. And that is really annoying. Previous 3 courses were great, maybe this one will improve.",1
99165,"It's globally a nice course, although you have to keep in mind that it is more like an introduction to the topic rather than a real, full course. I was quite frustrated from time to time that some important and difficult points are not really justified or explained in details, but just given as assumption or obvious concept: If you are familiar with that concept, you will be fine (but probably won't learn that much), while if you are not you will be probably lost. I mean, for a free course this is already a pretty nice job, and I think it is worth to take this course. I would be for sure ready to pay something to get a longer and more detailed course on this topic.",3

82676,"A daily demanding course, which could have benefitted from more time spent in some areas - particular signals. The video explaining a sample Signal implementation was very rushed and provided too little detail on a lot of information that seems to be taken for granted.",3
64423,Awesome. Waiting for the next one.,5
81225,"Great, engaging course!",5
52673,Great intro to Arrays/LIst/HashMaps and other container classes in Java. Lots of hands-on java coding exercises.,5
73891,"If you plan to purchase this course, enjoy, but the course isn't really free.You can watch the lectures, but you must pay to unlock the python playground. There's no real point to the course if you can't test your knowledge.",1

16700,"Pros: Information is perfect for anyone looking at Business Intelligence as a career field, or already in the career field itself. I found the first week to challenge my on-the-job knowledge of a fuller set of concepts and general terminology.Cons: The wording on the quiz questions, in some cases, seems much different than the PPT slides and the instructor's language. UPDATE: The wording is a significant challenge, even when advancing into the more complex topics. I have had many differences of opinions on the solutions based on wording in the requirements.",3

55640,"This is the first time that I took a course in Coursera. Prior to that, I did not believe in online courses! However, my perspective has changed dramatically! Andrew did a great job on this course and he motivated me much more about this topic. I enjoyed the course to the most and I am looking forward to applying it in developing my future applications. I highly recommend people, who are interested in machine learning, to take this course. I have to confess that the applications and assignments add another level of fun to this course. OCR, movie predictions, face recognition, etc are all fun and interesting. Thank you Andrew for all your efforts and I hope you offer an advanced machine learning in future in Coursera.",5

The lectures, quiz, assignments and the book - especially the book - all went together really, really well.In summary, one of the best put-together MOOC courses i've had the pleasure of attending. Thanks a ton!",5
95539,I loved all the formats that help us to get organized. I am a new teacher and they were awesome. Thank you very much.,5
66661,I really enjoyed the course.I learned a lot of things about specific pieces of modern art with some of which I was familiar to and with others I wasn't.The only thing I would say this course lacks is the fact that there are not enough assignments to work on and so we can not use our imagination and knowledge to write something inspiring!,4
81096,"I have to admit, this course greatly disappointed me from the beginning. The main reason is its title; it should have been ""Macroeconomics of the USA"". The instructor focuses too heavily on the US economy, which is partially understandable due to its significance, but I personally got tired of the endless supply of facts (and opinions) about US Presidents and their choices on US Macroeconomic Policy over the last 80 years.Other than that, the main concepts of Macroeconomics are presented with adequate detail. I had very little background in Economics but managed to grasp them rather easily. The presentations are pretty dull, however, with the professor mainly reading through the slides (which mind you are NOT in downloadable form).All in all, it's not a bad course, but there is great room for improvement.",3
56573,Perfect! Worth the money !,5
13036,"A very interesting course, even though I am not an astronomer. Plenty of examples on the use of Python for data handling, ML classification of astronomical objects (sklearn), plus a neat section on RDMS usage (postgresql + python).

27746,"I really liked this course; super interesting. It requires though the knowledge of Adobe Creative Suite, as there is a lot to work on it!",5
105292,"I enjoyed this class, but the content feels amateurish. One major detracting factor is grading of the exams- a complete waste of time where there are multiple examples of contradictory slides to the quiz questions. The quizes often ask for information that is beyond the scope of the lectures and steadily becomes a process of just retaking exams until you get a 100%. I don't think the quizes reinforced the material in the lecture but actually took away from the class. This class was at it's best during the recitals, where I actually got to understand the great strategies used in the videos.",5
59851,The course has provided the insights into what is machine learning and how machine learning algorithms works. It would be good if it can provide real world problems and how to approach to solve them.,3

10064,"Great course, but there is a problem with 2 of the exams not accepting correct answers.",4
17285,"The contents were very relevant and more geared to those with some experience already. The assignments are worth doing. The only problem is that some of the assignments have errors which are only listed in pinned posts in the forum (with a link to a ticket but nothing's been done about it). Still, learned a lot so the on the whole would recommend it.",5
34866,Thank you Nick! Yes I watched all your lectures and did all the quizzes and the assignments just for fun :),5

27092,"Great course, very well done and lot of stuff in it. There's a great job done by the teacher in planning and organizing everything, always very clear in the lessons and using clear examples to explain the concepts. My only suggestion would be to divide the last week into two different weeks, since there is lot of material in there, and cover a bit deeply Javascript language.",5

29255,Wonderful lecturer and fascinating material.,5
82624,It is a good course. I took it after Functional Programming Principles in Scala. I learned new things....But..... The reason i rate 3 is that:1) Programminng Assignments doesn't realy correspond to the Lecture material.2) The Lecture material becomes very complicated in some Lectures because of Lack of Explanation (e.g: Lec 4.3. There are still many disambiguations of how the Prof. creates some models (again lack of explanation)3) Too many unanswered critical questions remain in the forum!!!Anyway it's worth your time.,3

57388,A great course. Very interesting and simplified.,5
54370,"Excellent course. Andrew Ng provides valuable instruction on the intuition and implementation of machine learning algorithms. Even better, he gives lot of advise on how to create effective and performant machine learning systems like accuracy metrics and troubleshooting techniques. The main drawback about this material, for me, is that machine learning has evolved since this course's inception. While these are excellent foundations, I wish there was almost a part two for more state of the art material, especially deep learning and an expansion of neural networks. This is just the beginning and it was a great place to start.",5

102387,"I have a negative opinion of the structure of this course. It is not laid out in a format that I, a native English speaker, understood. The interviews and recorded lectures were not adequate or sufficiently rehearsed. The gentleman that drills his own cavities in his home workshop was most annoying and pointless. Looked at the ceiling Buddha 97% of his screen time.The reading was too disjointed and the book on Mindfulness is really more commercial and repetitious that one would expect of a course in Coursera. Professor Wright is too laconic, phlegmatic and unengaging. I wrote the assignment for week three but there were no instructions on how to convert a document in textedit (Mac WP) to the course submission page so that was a total crash for me.

However, I soon got used to it, and it was very helpful addition to the normal instructional videos.

This course is a must for people interested to delve into OPV, especially as a starting point for research. The course covers into detail almost from cradle to grave about OPV, and what I like most is that they highlighted a lot of previous and current experiments and research regarding OPV. Some of the quizzes can be a bit challenging as a few of them require 100% to pass. But all in all, 5 stars for me. Congratulations on a course well done.",5

I LIKE THAT THERE IS INTERACTION BETWEEN PEERS AND HOW THERE IS FEED BACK FROM EACH OTHER, BUT I DONT LIKE THAT IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET AN OPINION, IT DOESNT SEEM TO BE ENOUGH, IF I GET FEEDBACK FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS AS LITTLE AS ME OR IS BEGINNING TO EXPLORE GRAPHIC DESIGN, I WOULD HAVE LIKED AN OPINION FROM A PROFESIONAL OR A TEACHER WITH MORE EXPERIENCE. ALSO, AFTER FEEDBACK THERE SHOULD BE A CORRECTION ASSIGNMENT OR A GROWTH OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE FEEDBACK AND MAKE YOUR PROJECT BETTER.",3

75049,"Extremely basic. I wouldn't even call this a full course. It's about half of an introductory course. I assume the pacing is to allow for people that may have difficulty with learning the language. I'm not certain that it has the depth necessary for those that may have difficulty though. If you are at all serious about learning to program, don't limit yourself to this course, or it's pacing. I would suggest researching every subject covered, to get a bit more depth, and moving through it at a brisk pace. If you take the pace suggested in the course, you're likely to have bought a new computer before you can program anything extremely useful.",2

I had difficulties at first to understand and follow the way he presents his lectures, but through out time, I was eventually able to grasp the essence of his talks. This course would be difficult for people with NO finance background (like me). The only way I was able to go through this course successfully is by taking notes (pages & pages) and reviewing it before/through the exam. The notes will remain as a basic archive for my future studies.Thank your Robert & thank you Yale for my 2nd Certif in a row.Rachad Koaik - 27yo - Engineer - Morocco - Rachad.Koaik@Gmail.com",5

45419,"Various helpful techniques but I did find the course rather boring, especially the multiple-choice questions and all the ""scientific"" facts about the brain. It also seems more geared towards high-school or university students than towards the general public, so maybe I was just not in the target audience.",3

42066,"Well, while I felt really frustrated after having played ALL of this course videos, I have first put very negative comments here for its reviewing. I have then been kindly asked to reconsider my comments under the light of the usefulness of this course to some audience. For sure, it might be that I was not of the attended audience. And I still think that this course was of no interest to me - this is the reason why I'm still pleased not to have paid for its useless certificate. Nevertheless, this course might be of interest for some students. This is definitively true. So, let me suggest a new title for it: ""Design and Make Infographics for the Dummies"". Because that's it! This course is definitively perfect for the ones who know nothing about Infographics and they might enjoy it. Finally, I shall neither modify nor remove my previous comments on the examples used by the author.Please notice that Coursera still gets all my confidence about the usefulness and the quality of their proposed courses. For instance, just have a look to the course ""Machine Learning"" of one of its co-founders, Andrew Ng.------------------------------------My previous comments here below:For sure I was not the correct audience for this course. But nothing useful to be learned in here. Karl Gude is too much speaking of what he has formerly done, which is of only interest to him. I dislike the examples he uses : violence, sex, illness, accidents, weapons, war, drugs - and fruits, ok. Are these the only topics of interest to him? Finally, it appears that the $45 certificate does not worth it. I'm pleased not to have paid for it. And I definitively not recommend this course. Waste of time if not even waste of money.",1

97556,"Really enjoyed the material. The videos were simple, especially for a beginner. This is the first course I completed online and the experience was really good. Prof. Bakker is an able instructor and the concepts were well explained. The tests were simple though. Most of them took only one or two attempts to pass. That counts as a positive by the way.",5

I was looking for guidance in growing my storytelling abilities. I thought this class was fantastic for that, and I feel that I have some more tools in my belt moving forward. Not only that, this class made me excited about writing! I enjoyed the interviews that Brando did with other teachers. Brando as a teacher is fantastic, he is clear and concise, and you can tell he is passionate about writing. On top of that, he has a lovely kind demeanour, which made the videos a pleasure to watch. I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking for tools to advance their writing. I'm looking forward to the next class in this series on Character!",5

93579,"Learning R is very interesting and applicable. It is something I plan to continue, but not in the specialization offered here. The main reason being that the difficulty of the assignments seemed far beyond the material presented in the lectures. It could be that relevant examples on using applicable functions to aid in completing assignments were not presented in the lectures.",3
18488,"The course is well put together, however they say you do not need any programming background, but you definitely need a little. I had to use other sources to help such as Codeacademy and Udemy just to keep up. The do not go over loops, conditionals or basic C foundation that would help. The leap from HTML, CSS to JavaScript is massive. They need to relook some of the topics and either more videos or add in some easier teaching methods. I took a similar one on Udemy (that was free) just after I completed this one and it was 10x easier to understand and closed so many loops I had when learning JavaScript.",3

64429,Heck yeah!! its finally here :D,5
43801,It's helpful.,5
62762,"I had high expectations of this course, but must admit I'm pretty disappointed. Navigating the course feels unintuitive and clunky. Not sure if that's just a Coursera thing though. The actual content (video) looks great, but is unfortunately exceedingly brief, so much so, that it feels like this entire course could have just been a single article. In fact, there's not much presented that really benefits from the video format. Most 'instruction' in the course is centered around brief talks, or artist interviews, and thus you're often just looking at two people talking, or an artist showing you their work while they talk. You never even see anyone draw to my recollection.The 'work' in the course feels rather 'phoned in' at times too. Questions such as ""What did you find interesting about the video you just watched?"" seem unnecessary, and too elementary to contain any real value, especially when the videos are so brief.Having said all that, I DO think the people who made it are genuine, and have passion for comics, and comics education, and I'll continue to follow their efforts on that front.",2
97006,"Excellent course for students and researchers who want to start exploring systematic reviews and meta-analysis! There some few minor problem with the materials. Also, I wished there more advanced information regarding meta-analysis. Maybe you can develop an second course :)",4

87947,"Many thanks to our professor for taking the time to patiently explain and describe PR's key elements, giving numerous examples and giving a rich overview. As I strongly enjoyed the course I will be continue with followup lessons. However, regarding improvements I would have preferred written assignments instead of Quizzes as they were too 'easy' to pass. Also, PR being a field which requires strong written skills, I would have liked to improve this.",5

402,"A very nice experience. I expected an entry level course, but Erin organised a well rounded path. I got a new effective approach to the Ableton Live 9 software.I recommend to develop carefully your assignments: you will improve your own skills by comparing your solutions with those of the classmates. In addiction you'll find some ""veteran"" student willing to help.Good luck!",5
47486,"I wish I had this course available when I was starting to learn. This courses provides a approach to learning any area one is interested or required to learn. Madame Curie said ""Nothing is to be feared but understood..."". This subject makes understanding something new easier so that we don't fear the new but enjoy the learning process.",5
54021,A really nice guide to machine learning. I've starting seeing myself as a machine which was programmed with some algorithms to predict the accuracy of a particular decision and therefore humans are so much intelligent and best at their work.

37087,bad explanation and poor introduction,2
103962,not well prepared course,1
55358,"I would definitely recommend this course! I was very impressed by the quality of the lectures. Professor Ng uses the medium very well. He's easy to follow and the content is solid.The assignments were also good. They provide a ton of scaffolding, so you rarely have to write a lot of code, but if you never used Matlab before (like me) and it's been awhile since you've taken linear algebra (also true for me), then ""thinking in terms of vectorization"" takes a bit of getting used to. I'm really happy that I've been exposed to it, though, and it's pretty impressive how much computation you can express in one or two lines of Matlab.I only had to use the forums once at the beginning to figure out why I couldn't submit assignments. (It turned out that my version of Octave was too new for what the assignments had been tested with.) Once I got that sorted out, I never had to go back there for help, which I thought was a good sign that the assignments were clear and had been through sufficient testing by the staff.It's certainly a bit of a time commitment. I would probably budget at least 5 hours per week. I took a lot of notes, so I paused/rewound the videos a bunch, so it took longer for me to ""watch"" the videos than the advertised time.Again, the assignments were often not that much code, and I think they started to take me less time as I progressed through the course as I got more familiar with Octave and the style of the assignments. They aren't there to trick you or separate the wheat from the chaff: they're really there to reinforce the concepts from lecture and have you write some code yourself so you have some chance of writing your own code for your own project machine learning project one day.If anything, the assignments provide much more help than I expected. That is, if this were an in-person course where I could go to office hours or whatever if I got stuck, I would expect the assignments to provide less scaffolding and to force you to struggle quite a bit on your own more. (Maybe I just have bad flashbacks to undergrad or something.)",5
92909,"This is exceptionally nice program, it really give me a great sense of R and some absolutely fascinating skill to work with data.

96957,"Very well organized, chock full of both theoretical content and details regarding application. Just the right amount of challenging! Would have been nice to have had more exercises that force you to use the information learned in actually choosing/not choosing studies, or writing about the literature systematically.

44365,"I found this course extremely helpful in doing exactly what it proposes to do. It breaks down ideas on how to study more efficiently, as well as focusing on retention. I especially enjoyed the week focusing on procrastination, as I have a hard time with that to point debilitation at times. This course has helped me to view things I would ordinarily avoid and I now try to make them a challenge or a goal to overcome. The course did not take so much time either, there is no reason you could not fit this into your schedule. I definitely recommend this course to strangers and I have already suggested it to my friends and family as well.",5
28170,The strongest part of this course is that it prompts the learners to apply the designing skills.,4
45301,Awesome course! Learning is explained in simple terms and the tips and best practices really stick to your memory. The course has definitely achieved what it is teaching - which is making sure you remember the material by testing yourself and by utilizing spaced repetition. I loved the simplicity of the course. Make sure you watch all optional interviews as they are with people who achieved great results in the area of learning or memory.,5

16803,"Pretty good course. While the assessments are pretty much just a repeat of the in-video questions, I feel I was still able to learn a fair amount.",4
87465,"The course is both fun and full of learning. Dr Chuck is a wonderful teacher. He puts forth concepts in a way that is easy to relate and in absorb-able chunks. Still he manage to impart sufficient knowledge for us to start coding interesting applications. Thanks a ton, Dr Chuck.",5

20316,"The course helped me understand that being afraid is common but that giving one step forward proves fear wrong.It opened my ideas to a million more, it guided me into clearer ways of understanding how my idea can come true. I definitely recommend this course if you don't even know where to start from. Don't underestimate the time you need to work on it ;)",5
24284,"I found this course very interesting and useful. Even though it is more based on theory than in practice, it really manages to provide a wide range of ideas about different aspects that influence on education.

32271,thank you for the amazing course!,5
2928,"The best part about this course is the way Prof. explains the intuition behind most of the proofs.

65970,Course was fascinating! Clearly presented. I loved the structure with a summary at the end of each lecture. The quizzes contained only information that was included in the lectures. Easy familiarity of the instructor made me feel like we were having a friendly discussion. Instructor intended to present information to the general public rather than psychology majors & he accomplished that goal. This is my favorite MOOC so far & I never expected to find one I liked more than the,5

45280,"Thanking Barbara Oakley for all the efforts she has taken to make this course available. This Course has helped me alot in understanding how our Brain and thoughts works and functions, it also helped me develop a better memory for a better future. Once again i'm grateful to all the team.",5
72326,"Good things:â€¢ Simple, clear concepts that serve as a foundation for further study of finance.â€¢ Many examples, repeated often to help gather basic ideas.â€¢ A pace that is easy to follow.â€¢ Friendly lecturer, even entertaining at times; which makes lessons fun to watch.â€¢ Helpful and kind teaching assistants.Not so good things:â€¢ Lessons alone don't teach you what you need; they don't even hint at some formulas that are necessary to pass the test.â€¢ Because of that, expect to find surprising problems and ideas on tests. You'll need to spend a long time working on them, probably attempt multiple times, and definitely visit the fora to consult with others.â€¢ Lack of assignments or already-solved exercises, similar to the ones used on the tests. There are only tests. Self-assessing assignments would be helpful to ""try"" the tests before actually attempting them.â€¢ The course is actually 5 weeks long (not 6 as stated, since there's an ""empty"" week). I doubt that's useful as the staff claim (I simply skipped one week and continued normally).â€¢ The professor insists repeatedly on a grandiose, philosophical, cheesy view of finance (how it'll make your life so much better, how it's applicable to so many aspects, how money isn't everything) but, in my opinion, betrays that spirit from day one by sticking to the most obvious applications and examples. He could, for example, show how these methods would apply to food supplies, barter, social prestige, trustworthiness, confidence in people or institutions, certainty about logic assertions, or other things that aren't measurable in dollars. He could use real-life examples (disastrous financial decisions in History, GDP of countries, international trade, loans taken by cities or countries, etc), and that would make it so much more engaging (I only remember one question about the price paid for the Manhattan island). He doesn't even use other currencies in examples nor tests.",3

25634,"Great overview of how games are designed. Course includes brief overviews of key topics in a game such as mechanics, rules, story/narrative, input/output, and user experience. While not very detailed on each aspect the overview provides a starting point of the various ideas and components to consider when developing a game. Additional resources on examples of games and articles on the topics are useful in further exploring the concepts.",4

13704,"I enjoyed this course. Brando did a good job in breaking down the important aspects of plot and providing examples. I liked that lessons were concise. Each one contained roughly three videos, most less than 10 minutes. I thought this was very beginner friendly. I found Feyman's pyramid and Alice Adam's ABDCE of plot structure particularly useful and I especially enjoyed the Shop Talk videos where fellow writers discussed their approach to writing. I only audited this course, but it bugged me that my board kept displaying overdue assignments when that feature was locked.",4

26346,best and very valuable course,4
4273,Course only drilled down on specific aspects of excel that were inclined to regression analysis which is just one aspect used in business analysis,3
55051,"Fantastic course. Helped me get from zero technical knowledge of machine learning all the way to the point where I feel comfortable implementing and can think through those implementations. The course itself is very math-intensive and gives a deep technical understanding of machine learning, rather than just a code-based approach. I feel like this is useful, but I would not recommend this course to people with no coding experience or people who are uncomfortable with linear algebra (primarily matrix operations for vectorized implementations of algorithms). My only criticism is that the course moved slowly at some points, but I took time off to take the course in several days rather than over a few months. I imagine the reminders and short review of topics that have already been covered would be very useful to people taking the course at the recommended pace.",4

57113,"If you are on the fence as to whether or not to take the class... take it!This class was magnificent. I had very little background (college calculus years ago and minimal computer science experience) and was able to follow the lessons, learn the concepts and apply them. I took the course to get a sense of data science and algorithmic analysis, and I came away more excited about the field and prospects than before! You get to learn at a high level how life-changing technology we interact with every day works--how autonomous cars learn to drive, how Netflix picks what movies you might like, and how text recognition algorithms can learn new text. How cool is that!?In part because of this class, I am now confident in my ability to study data science as a possible career.",5

As I am using this for a quick review for my music theory to supplement my years of piano music before taking the AP Music Theory exam later this year, this course is very informational and helpful.

72685,"gets way too in-depth with the math behind regression, to the point that it deters from the learning process. was hoping to learn better methods of interpreting or enacting regression, not the inner workings of the algorithms.assignments got overly complex with confusing instructions. there are definitely some leaps made in the assumptions of what students' python capabilities are. vague instructions caused more frustration than desire to continue learning.will continue in the specialization, but will not hesitate to drop out if instruction continues like this.very disappointed.",1

85334,"The Course is well planned and intended to give clarity with regard to the basics of interplay between law and economics. The best part is that anyone taking the course wouldn't feel like taking classes but, listening to a interesting story, in the process we learn key concepts. Prof Richard Adelstein has a delivery style which is simple that it seems like he is making a 8 year old understand it. So any one above eight years can take the class. The class lays down the foundation to our understanding of law and economics.",4
44101,Changed my approach to learning totally,5
85404,The best introduction to functional programming I've seen. The course lectures make for a smooth learning experience and the exercises in the assignments range from simple to moderately challenging and are a good complement for the lectures.,5

101578,"The course was great in that it moves you to write. I actually completed a pilot script that I was very proud of. My only criticism of the course would be the peer review. For the most part the reviews were weak and lacking substance. I put a lot of energy into reviewing classmates works but I can't say that I got back what I put out. This may be improved with a video teaching students what kind of feedback is expected of them. Other than that, it's worth the time.",4

13569,"[Slightly updated according to Michael's questions]The course is fine, but comparing to the previous one - Algorithmic Toolbox - this one is weaker and with lesser quality.Pros: the course contains some interesting data structures and valuable observations. The starter files for assignments are in place. Related books are given after each video session. All the tasks have automatic grader. There is a couple of interesting tasks to do.Cons: the material is mostly lectures, and there is even a video where lecturer just reads the article from Wiki (Splay tree - has the same information with same lack of some proofs). Expected: add quizzes as it was in the first course. The course has less weeks - only 4 as comparing to 5 in AT. So various important data structures are not discussed. The course has less homework - 3 tasks each week as comparing to 5 in AT. And all 3 are usually just implementations of some basic algos seen in lectures.I consider the course valuable due to a number of good videos and a couple of good tasks to do. But in general, this course has the area for improvement.",3

96694,"This is the second course in the Full Stack series by Hong Kong University. Because I find the first course in this series very interesting (the assignments are challenging and easy to understand; the professor does a very good job in explaining the materials), I continue to take the second course, which is this one, a shoot. However, it is a complete disappointment.In every single assignment, it requires a file, which is built by going through every single lectures of the course. That means I have to go through every videos and copy his code to my code in order to get the file. If you have a lot of time, that is perfectly fine. However, if you are a college student like me, you properly will not be able to commit that much time. Personally, when I take a course, I take a look at the assignment and then see what knowledge I need to have in order to complete the assignment. Because of this, I may watch the lecture or just Google out the answer. Requiring a file in order to complete an assignment strips away my liberty in doing so. Furthermore, if you miss a step in the video, your file may very well be ruined and you need to rewatch the video again to see what you missed.Also, the course is extremely slow paced. I have to play back rate to x1.5 normal speed. Sadly, even with faster speed, the lectures are also poorly structured. There are many other materials online that can cover the same amount of information in less time and easier to understand. Combined with the required file for each assignment, this course can easily be a torture.",2

18875,I enjoyed the course as it highlights many strategies and insights into making effective visualizations. It makes good use to Tableau and gives practical examples. The only thing I would like to see added is a simple instruction manual to accomplish some of the methods they employed. Overall I think it was great to have this as a second course in the series because it lays the foundation for good design practices.,5

94104,I am so glad I took this course! I have learnt what I consider very important aspects of virtual teaching such as identifying at-rist students or building a community with the students that engages them in the learnig.

93814,"This is a challenging course because there is a marked gap between the video lectures and the weekly assignments. This course will be far more demanding of your time and willingness to fail that the Data Scientist's Toolbox. If you have the time and resilience to search out support materials and frequently peruse the Discussion threads, you will be able to find what you need. My peers with programming experience confirmed that there is too wide a gap between the content delivered in the video lectures and the demands of the coding assignments. If you decide to take this course, be sure to do the swirl exercises so you get a feel of how the R functions work. When you grade your peers' work, you might notice that more than a few decided to plagiarize code from others.The videos need to be redone. Effective instructors know that students learn by seeing examples, not by listening to broad descriptions of what a function can do.",2
50962,"Course title is misleading. It is actually a course on Managing Agile Software development, not Product management.There is common understanding in active product management community that major focus for product manager is market. Market is not mentioned in this course at all.What requirements and schedule, guys??? Current product management is all about hypotheses, A/B testing, customer development, experiments, lean UX, etc.You completely missing the point.Still, this course can be a good one for those who want to start Managing agile software development.",1

106000,Lack practical aspect analysis. Most of the materials are more theoretical (some of the graphs are not necessary and does not help understanding the discussing topic and increases confusion.

34804,"Very Good for Beginners, Everything is explained in a very understandable way, the access to the program and the additional data makes it whole round.",5
25482,"This course has a lot of info to offer. The instructor is enthusiastic and provides lots of helpful links to articles, books, and resources that are really useful. I also appreciate that there is a portion of the course dedicated to social issues in games, which often get overlooked or dismissed.However, the course appears to have been restructured at some point, which can make the videos confusing, as they refer to things you haven't learned yet or make you wonder if you accidentally skipped a video somewhere. That said, I also don't think the current structure is ideal, because what you're learning is sometimes at odd with the structure of the assignmentsâ€”for instance, a game design doc isn't finished until a game is nearly done while a prototype should come early in the process. So why does the game design doc assignment come before the prototype assignment?Also, while I appreciate that the instructor attempted to make the quizzes and grading more fun, the resulting options are often misleading or unclear. For example, the typical grading options are 1) You barely did it or didn't do anything, 2) You went above and beyond, and 3) This is pretty epic. If the person satisfied the requirements but didn't add anything else, do they really only deserve a 1? I didn't grade that way, but the options suggest I could have. Also, if the question is ""Is this a zip file?"" these options don't make sense at all.Overall though, I recommend this course and give it 4 stars for the level and variety of information it covers.",4

94434,"Like the way the Prof uses media. This is a very light touch on a very deep subject so it has to balance analytical work with the light ""trust me and just do it"" approach. The balance was mostly there although on a couple items I don't know that I had a good enough grip to know what I don't know.",4
49217,"Although the instructor was good at presenting the information, I felt that the reference sheets should of had the phonetic pronunciations next to the Korean writing. This would of helped learn the symbols better. After the second week, we were expected to know what they represented. I felt it needed a video on just learning the alphabet. I did still learn a great deal of vocabulary.",3

I have a Computer Science degree and worked as a professional game developer on released iOS and Android Unity games, and even though the material was a breeze, I still learned from it. Fits the description as a good introduction. The code week kind of throws beginners into the deep end a bit (lots of material just sort of thrown at you, but they warn you about the ramp up requirements). Good idea to invest time in some beginning programming resources before you dive into the week 4 material. What are you waiting for? Enroll!",5
27356,"The course content is very solid. It focuses heavily on the tools and technique, and there lacks the concepts and biology behind those tools. But I would guess there is some prior courses in this specialization explaining the concepts, though I didn't take them.The tools explained in this course is the most popular ones for handling up-stream analysis. They are the must-have ones for current bioinformatician jobs.The instructor, Dr Liliana Florea, did a great job, walking you through those tools step-by-step. I also found the exercises (exams) highly useful.The course title is not the most accurate one. The title is not very catchy either. This course is more about the tools for analyzing next generation sequence data.",5

100768,"HiFirst of all I just want to write I have a background in mechanical engineering and I know the working principles of solar cells quite well. I just wanted to check out this course.I started this course but I find that it is very difficult to concentrate. I tried pinpointing exactly what the problem was and I came up with following:There is too much talking and not enough going on visually. I know you have a person in front of a white screen, and a few visual effects such as floating words and diagrams. It is just not working for me. I have a hard time remembering what you said. I can pause and go back again which is always nice but the info still doesn't stick. This especially true for the LCA part, which I don't even think is a difficult concept to grasp.I think the best courses I have seen online is not particularly rehearsed and it is usually just a guy, with a pen, running you through some examples to illustrate the working principles. Afterwards they do an everyday life example. I find that these courses always help me a lot.I am sorry about the 2 stars but I hope you see it as a room for improvement. It is probably a first time for you guys to use an online platform as a media so it will take a couple of iterations to get it right.I did like when you illustrated Isc and Voc in terms and abbreviations. More stuff like that, possibly also with an electrical diagram etc and som flow analogy.If I can propose anything it would be to organize it a bit more like Michigan Universitys Python learning series. I think it is quite good and the assignments are also challenging but you learn a lot.Anyway thanks a lot for the course. I hope you will find a way that works.",2
5606,"Great Introduction to the topics and broad concepts of bioinformatics. If you are looking for a course that goes gives you a sense of the breadth of the field, this is the place to start. The learn-at-your-own-pace was also great for me, since time commitments and travel schedules make it difficult for me to block out a set time each week to complete each lesson-- so the flexibility was great!",5

11552,"Enjoyed the breakdown of the lessons from the core characteristics of ASD, to the DSMV diagnostic criteria, increasing rates and demographics, patterns of strengths and weaknesses, the explanation of Theory of Mind, and finally the evidence based practices and interventions. I am glad that massage therapy was listed as an emerging intervention. Massage has helped my son, and many other children on the spectrum, with sensory regulation and activation of the parasympathetic NS to help calm the fight or flight response, and tactile defensiveness. Would love to see UC Davis MIND institute do more research into this area, like that of the Touch Research Institute. Excited for more research and information!",5

101309,"this course is very basic, provides a lot of information that's not really practical or useful. i suppose someone who's seeing internet for the first time would find it informative, but not very engaging. as for the majority of those who use coursera to self-educate it would probably seem a bit too much of stating the obvious. also I'd like to mention the delivery of the information - its a text that's read aloud. nothing more - well, thanks for that. I can read faster than I can listen to a video. if you're making a video - make it worth actually WATCHING.",1

So, it is very simple.But, I think that these lectures lacks logiccal explanation. Even in beginning, the logical sturucte is undoubtedly important for further learning.And, Quiz are really easy. So, you can finish this course even in a day if you have a sufficient time. I do not think that this course will make someone really spaek Chinee in China. But, this should be recommended for only those are interested in Chinese and do not have a plan to go to china.",3

95398,"This is a *very* good Python Pandas course that's part of a data science specialization that I wish existed 3-4 years ago when I first started using Pandas. As much as I like Wes McKinney's book ""Python for Data Analysis"", having an e-learning format mixing video lectures and hands-on assignments is a definite plus.I've decided to take this class out of curiosity (and in order to get ideas about a class I'm about to teach), and even if I consider myself as an experienced pandas user (top5% on stackoverflow for [pandas]). I think it's pretty involved if you're new to pandas and covers pretty much every key concept of pandas you should (must?) be aware of. The assignments can certainly look very challenging to the newcomer, and they do a great job of looking like an actual project: messy data, multiple sources, etc.I dearly recommend - and I have already started to personally recommend it - this course for anyone who's interested in learning more about data wrangling in pandas!Thanks for putting this together!",5

56998,Great theoretical introductory course for Machine Learning.,5
101087,"The course provides a case. We have to identify the problem. I appreciated the fact that how I define a problem decides on how I propose to address it. A different definition leads to altogether different steps! The course also provides a good template and sufficient guidelines to help us develop a strategy to address the problem we have defined. Finally , we have to think about how we can test if our strategy is viable. We are also guided to think about the changes that might be necessary in our organization in terms of structure, KPIs, skills etc. Given the nature of this capstone project one cannot expect it to be too specific and have a heavy application of analytics. What it does is provide you with a good idea of how to put all that you have learned in each of the specializations in a comprenesive manner, and that how these ideas fit together to create a big picture. If you are looking at complex number crunching excerices then you will not find it here. If you are looking for excerices that will make you think and think and think then you will be quite satisfied. I am!",5

73851,Very Nice course to give a head start in Python,5
9299,I think the instructor is great.,5
19034,"My feeling is that this MOOC is very inspiring in way that it brings out the fact and paradox that we previously were reluctant to say out , and that is we are not saving lives in an effective way and that's how we actually should behave if we are real egalitarians in ourselves. And it also provides us with simple tools to make analysis by ourselves.Space for improvement could lie in that the links between videos and reading materials of a same module or block could be strong, at least sometimes they don't seem so hooked with each other to me or I sometimes got confused what these contents together show something different from other blocks.",4

28227,"Loving this course! It has a really nice pace. I always prefer shorter videos cause then I can divide the week up and not have to find hours to do it all at the same time. Also it is easier to think along (I am doing it as an after work extra activity). Probably a lot of things are basics but this was exactly what I was looking for. Also the system of mandatory and optional tasks is really nice cause people can choose how deep they want to go. I have skipped optional things cause I do not want to design myself, more work better together with the designers but I might change my mind during the next course cause I am definitely taking the hole spezialisation!",5
67581,"Yet another really excellent course in this series - the best online course I have ever taken.

39394,"I liked the assignment, and the course... for the most part. What I didn't care for was so much time being spent on the IBM BlueMix and other software tutorials. I don't really see the value in those software, and it felt very sales pitch-y. I can't imagine using them in my day to day, so it just felt like a waste of time.

I really appreciate going over all the algorithms in this course and I have a better understanding of how we explore graphs to find valuable information. I really enjoyed the challenge optional week as well. I felt less stress to complete it since it was optional, but it was still very challenging and I couldn't complete it (even though I really tried). I feel the challenge optional week may need to be made slightly easier though to give people who are normally busy to get a chance to try and solve the problems in it (it did eat up a lot of my spare time). Excellent work, great course (wish I knew contraction hierarchies better, been reading some papers but still unsure of how to best implement it).",5
22623,Definitely helped me understand some of the lingo use,5

106436,"Generally, a good course.The lectures and supporting talks were instructive, helpful, and inspiring. The instructors and industry experts were well chosen.The assignments were pretty good. They provided nice constraints and freedom of expression to come up with ideas and think about how one might create and adapt a story world so that meaningful experiences can be had from it. The peer review process was good, but I would have liked instructor feedback as well (I suppose it is free for because of only being peer reviewed though).",4

981,"I would recommend this course to anyone who has some experience with coding, but has not taken an algorithm course. I particularly like this course because it is more ""math-heavy"" than some of the other courses. After taking this course, you might not be able to solve all Leetcode problems (so probably will not help with your interviews directly), but from an intellectual point of view, I think the instructor does a good job explaining why people care about algorithms and how to analyze a class of algorithms rigorously.",4

78133,Dr Charles Severance has made the course even more engaging and interesting.I couldn't have asked for a better mentor.Looking forward to attending more of his lectures.Thanks,5

80758,"Excellent delivery, very simple and in depth analyses of the negotiation process.",4
81397,"I really enjoyed it. The only thing was I had to read the scripts on the videos in order to follow the thoughts and ideas because I'm used to read and understand faster than in the way you expressed the ideas. Other than that it was a great course. Very enlightening. And also gave me hope for psychology since most of whet we study at school is about problems and pathologies, never solutions.",4

2525,"This is an excellent course. You are given a six month license to use Tableau as well as practice data for the assignments and exercises. It is very practical and informative. It covers more than just Tableau. The first week is about framing data questions and working with stakeholders. The second and third week cover Tableau. The last week gives some very helpful tips for giving effective presentations. The final assessment will go over all of these things, so be prepared to put them to use if you want the final certificate.",5
17466,"The peer reviewed assignments are next to useless, as there is no oversight on them. I think there needs to be a basic comprehension assessment done first, before allowing fellow learners the ability to pass/fail students in the course.",1

69073,"Course is well organized, lectures explain learning concepts very well. And using python notebook examples to show machine learning uses are very unique and quite easy to follow. The assignments may not have been as challenging as some other school's courses, but overall, this is a great course for those who would like to have a practical approach to apply machine learning to solve data problems.",5
70151,"While the lectures were good, one of the mentors wasn't profesional at all, she was nasty, though the other one was very fine.But my chief complaint is the terrible method (in creative writing classes only ?) of using peer reviews to pass the class. I had a non-English-speaking person NOT pass me, a former English teacher, for no other reason than he misread the assignment. So I had to resubmit. I don't know who finally passed me, I think the peer review process is a shambles, and it lets Coursera personnel out of the process of doing grading and opens a can of worms with an incompetent peer reviewer having the power to not pass me. I don't think I will be taking creative writing classes again at Coursera, as going through that broken peer review process and having one mentor being off the wall just wasn't worth my time and anxiety.",2
42206,"This is really one of my beloved courses. It is not only about how to keep talent and develop it inside your team, it is discovering lots of extremely important keys to keep your team updated and flexible of fast change.

84216,A good course for data structures in python... Gives a great learning experience with problem solving abilities...,5
2784,"The capstone project and corresponding course work is amazing. The project is framed as a business analysis problem with you acting as the analyst. You are tasked with exploring the company's database to extract the relevant information, construct a predictive model in Excel, visualize the results in Tableau, and deliver a persuasive presentation for your expert recommendation. This project actually utilizes skills learned throughout the specialization with an actual application of knowledge. Duke doesn't leave you stranded though. The course offers quizzes along the way to ensure that you have the correct values to arrive at the correct assumptions at each step so you know you can accomplish this task. I highly recommend this project and thank the University for this learning opportunity.",5
52776,Not as advertized and way too much peer rating stuff--we do all the work the instructor does little or none--too much peer rating stuff which I despise. And there seems to be no way to un-enroll.,1
13829,"I finished this course in a single day in roughly about 8 hours, including taking notes and doing writing assignments. The material is quite good, more geared towards the beginner to the concepts of Plot. But, in my favorite parts - the interviews with Amity Gaige and Amy Bloom, I discovered new sides and tones to Character and Setting. And, they now compel me towards doing the rest of the courses in this specialization.I really wish I could submit my assignments even without the certificate version of the course.Thank you Mr. Skyhorse and the Coursera team. :)",4

20983,"Overall, this was good study for learning basic functions in Excel. However, the tutorials and practice quizzes do not adequately prepare you for the actual graded Quiz at the end of each week that counts toward your final grade. You will definitely have to be either a quick study, who can pull a lot of inference and practical application out of minimal technical guidance, or know how to Google the steps that were glossed over in the videos or for which no practice question was provided. Also, side note, if you have a Mac, you will be somewhat flustered at times, and you will also need an add-on app for the Histogram portion.",3

10668,"For most people this might be four stars. There is solid content here, but I couldn't help but feel a lot of this stuff is fairly standard OD/management material and in some ways, it felt like asking, say, a project manager to deliver a data science course. If you have never done any managerial training or read material on intrinsic motivation, org and team culture, then you will get value. For me this was pretty stock",3

54569,Thanks Mr. Andrew NG very much!!!,5
54367,"Prof. Andrew Ng did a really excellent job in this course for understanding Machine Learning. The assignments, as well as the choice on programming language ensures that the learners can focus on the concept itself instead and less on the nuances of syntax. The lectures are well divided into sections interrupted by short quizzes that allows learners can self-check if they understood that particular segment before moving on to the next. This lesson is perfect not just in teaching the subject matter itself, but also in demonstrating how the lesson can be presented in a way that it can easily be understood.",5
48289,This course is one of the most important and useful on coursera.org. I am very grateful to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for preparing and sharing this course.,5

67284,"Lots of great material. A good place to start for those new to mindfulness and an opportunity to broaden and deepen one's practice for more long-term practitioners. A variety of religious and secular perspective are covered, both current and historical, with a view toward ethics and practical application. The perspective presented is unbiased and encourages independent thinking, self-analysis and reflection. It was well worth the time I invested and I intend to continue referring back to the notes I have made as well as the resources that have been provided throughout the course. I look forward to more from Prof. Goto-Jones in this area!",5

100934,Great course and i have feel that i have a better understanding of the fundamentals of project planning. There was so much that i never considered before and i will start to apply to my next future projects.,5
24349,Help on topics is very limited. Nothing more than instruction videos. Discussion forums are helpful only to solve assignments. There is hardly any input from instructor about genuine theoretical questions.,2

While the quizzes were hardly challenging, the lectures and various interviews more than made up for this by demanding active engagement with the material.

In the other two courses (Quantitative Modeling and Accounting Analytics) the excels were explained and available for download. This was an excel course and no excels available.....",3
72598,I learned quite a lot during this which I can use in practice. Everything is well explained in the video's. If I had to call a down side then I would say that I had a hard time with the math. This is because I never did something matrices and linear algebra.

64000,Best course I ever found,5
25891,"It's a simple and straight-forward course that brings you through the basics pretty fast. If you have the time, you could actually do the whole course in a day or two, just coming back for peer review. There are no surprises and the projects are simple. The instructor even lists what the objects of each lesson and video are, so if you need to look back at a specific feature, you need only look at the titles and then watch that one video. It's also interesting to see what people think of when creating a second level, if they try to go further.",4

34846,"I am an Architect-Planner by profession. Was looking for this course for quite sometime. I finally found it on Coursera. I had a great time learning Fundamentals of GIS. I had never before worked in Gis though I had a very little theoretical idea. But, at the end of this course, I was able to analyse and make my own map, something I had never done before with GIS. The lectures were to the point, with most of the details covered. The assignments for practice were very helpful too. This course comes with a very helpful reading materiaI and a year long licensed version of ArcGIS too. I had a great time in taking up the quizes, and the peer reviewed final assignment. I highly recommend this course. Last but not the least, thank you Nick Santos for teaching so well! got back to class almost after 8 years and had a great time! I am sure that this will help me taking up further studies in my field.",5
105162,"The only reason this excellent course does not have five stars is because of the technical issues that are the responsibility of Coursera and the failure of some of the peers to write peer reviews according to the instructions. I heartily recommend this course to anyone seeking to kick start, revive, or tune up serious writing.",4

I personally appreciate his clear enunciation of words and thorough explanations of his website-planning process and the tools needed to accomplish the goals.",5
92101,"This course does an excellent job of blending a basic introduction to relational databases and SQLite with some important tools in Python. Folks comfortable with SQL can probably skip most of the lecture in weeks 2 and 3, as the content is focused on learning SQL and using the SQLite browser as opposed to using Python with these tools. This was a great way to bring together the fundamentals from the first three courses in this specialization.",5

64314,"Compared with the regression course, this course was a slight disappointment. 1. there is less material compared to the regression course. Maybe this is because classification concepts are more intuitive. 2. the slides are much less prepared. Some of the sides even re-use earlier lesson slides in the beginning as a ""review"", much like soap operas re-use scenes from earlier episodes as ""memory recall"" to fill air time. 3. the math is more handwavy compared to the regression course. Neither course are supposed to go in depth with proofs, but I felt the regression course was at the right level and this course degraded too far. Do note it's very possible that I'm biased because I have seen more of the material from this course than the regression course.",3
17481,"loved this course, the prompts really got me thinking and writing about things/topics that were different for me. Being forced outside my comfort zone has really gotten me thinking about writing from a different angle and I think that will help so much moving back to my own writing",5
76638,"I had some experience with programming from 25 years ago, but I think that the videos, the book chapters, and the mentors that supported the discussions were all fantastic. I would highly recommend the class, and I would highly recommend Coursera in general. Thank you for the opportunity",5

51841,"Very enjoyable course. A big thank to all the teachers! Especially the humorous and charming Dr Dixon. I never thought American teachers could be so humorous as I have some bad experience with an American teacher when I was young.When I started my Form 1 secondary education at the age of 13, an American male teacher marched into our classroom and ordered us to have an English name each. He said that our Chinese names sounded silly to him and they were difficult to pronoun. I said to him as I came from a village and my mother was illiterate, could he recommend a name. He said that he didn't care, i could call myself Barbara, Mary, anything I like. I felt so insulted and that put me off from learning English for a long time.I guess he was using Direct approach at that time because he did not speak Chinese, and none of the students understood English then. We did not understand what he said throughout the whole year.I am proud of the name my father gave me and I still only use my Chinese name.",5

3357,"Overall, this is a very effective introduction to AngularJS. AngularJS can be intimidating or confusing, and this course is largely an introduction, but the videos and exercises do a great job of letting you get over the initial learning curve. This course will give you a thorough foundation in AngularJS, way better than any other free course online, and will give you an idea of where you can go off and explore on your own if you're interested in going on to develop intermediate skills.My only critique of this course is that I really had to explore the ""additional materials"" at the end of each section to get a grasp of some of the concepts. I found that some of the videos oversimplified pretty complicated subjects and weren't thorough enough to allow you to complete some of the exercises. I also think the course briefly introduces some pretty complicated tools too early to new developers and doesn't do a good job of explaining their value (like Grunt and Gulp).However, this course is still amazing for a free course. If you've done any of the quick tutorials in AngularJS (like codeacademy's), you've really only scratched the surface of AngularJS. A hands-on course like this give you a much better foundation. To conclude, despite it's minor flaws, this is still the best free introduction to AngularJS online today. Good luck!",4
15137,Good Start,5

Considering the high volume of travellers to areas with a higher risk of parasitic diseases, spending some time becoming more knowledgeable about them can only do good. For those with a medical education background, it may also be an opportunity to brush on some diseases usually only touched on during a standard university infectious diseases course. Some of them are really fascinating from a scientific view point. I would recommend also reading the PDF references, the articles are quite interesting. Best wishes.",5

24584,"The course is extremely helpful and the content is good. However, it is hard sometimes to follow the Principals/Directors teaching the course. Additionally, it would have been fantastic if a lot of time was spent on giving examples, practical work demonstrated and a thorough structure of how it was done.Maybe, all this will be coming in the future courses. But for beginners, it is hard to understand and catch interest on the topic if not discussed with detailed examples and not merely giving highlights on the examples.",3

74589,"This is fairly simple course the introduces students to the world of Python, without requiring any previous programming knowledge.

Due to my procrastination problem, I enroll for the coursera courses now and then, but middle of the session I drop out from each of the course. This is the first in Coursera that retained my interest to finish the course. I loved the concept of Pomodoro, Chunking techniques that have been taught in this course.

28318,"For what it was, it was a decent course. For some reason I thought it would be a little more advanced. This was a very basic class. Wording of the last assignment limited creativity as it was hard to tell if you had to limit your pictures to 2 shapes,(as in one circle and one square), or 2 shapes(as in as many circles as needed and as many triangles as you needed, but don't add any squares). Reviewing these assignments, because they were so basic, made it hard to offer much in the way of constructive criticism.",3
25916,"Great Course! You learn a lot about Unity; for someone who has never used it before. I've tried to start with Unity from books and tutorials on my own, but I never got as far in the 4 weeks of this course. You make three basic games, which gives you all the basics of Unity. Very well worth taking this course, and the instruction/materials are superior.",5

54734,One of the most informative courses for Machine Learning. Putting the use cases for the algorithms and methodically going step by step addressing the questions that would naturally occur. Waiting for a continuation of this course (aka part 2),5
32501,"I liked the course, with its many different speakers and approaches.The one thing I missed the most was seeing the models in action. Even if the course isn't aimed at scientists or programmers, there are free online simulations where one can adjust model constants to see the effects interactively without any knowledge required.See NetLogo at http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/, for which there are forest fire, disease spread in networks, cellular automatas and many other interactive simulations. Insight providing questions may involve finding the value of a parameter such as the epidemic can't spread, for instance.For more formula oriented optional exercises, I would recommend something similar to Differential Equations in Action from Udacity. It's a relatively easy course implementing the SIR model, physics and ABS. An exercise could be ""modify the simulation to consider X% germs get resistant after each antibiotic treatment"" (either in NetLogo, or Python).",4
91040,"I totally recomend this course, the professors are well prepared and is an honor learn from them and from your classmates. All the institutions related to this course expose very accurate cases.

103163,"Really a great course! Covering a lot of details, but the most important point is that this course gives a big picture of different levels of understanding of the brain and minds. From the basic neural circuits to network models of computation, and high level cognitive tasks such as emotion, and the instructor even extended the course a little bit to cover some philosophical implications of brain research. By the way, Idan Segev is REALLY A GOOD INSTRUCTOR ! ! ! Thanks for this great course. Hope there may be something like a extended (advanced) version of it later on.",5
102341,"Very interesting and enjoyable. There is much to contemplate in this rich dense course. I think I'll do it again and extract even more now that I've been through it once.

From brainstorming ideas to developing a concept to actually testing your game before release, this touches on the more difficult thought processes that one may not learn by simply picking up a game engine and learning how to build a game from the ground up. Couple the concepts learned here with the technical skills from the game development courses (or your own technical experience and knowledge), and you'll be much better equipped to make a solid, marketable product.",5

43909,This was a great course and i hope more people start to use these techniques. Putting this information in the hands of kids when they are young would be very useful.

90860,"My feeling is that the course creator(s) did not fully prepare and scope of the course materials (i.e., lectures, supporting artifacts, assignments) required for the available time alloted to each week's topic. No syllubus or suggested reading material was available until the course started, which leaves little time to decide on the value of the course or to acquire the reading materials. The lectures glossed over topics that where only minimally supported by brief supplementary lectures provided by the teaching assistants. At the start of the course the lectures and sparse supporting material were only available in video format; not very conducive for detailed review. The student population had to beg for electronic copies of the materials, which became available around the end of the second week of the four week session. The assignments say they require 3 hours, but I would venture to say that most students have spent way more than 3 hours on the assignments just in researching solutions let alone debugging supplied software along with their portion of the assignment. In summary, the topics were interesting however the organization and supporting materials were lacking making for an unsatisfying learning experience.",2

87988,"I enjoyed this course immensely! I was a bit hesitant due to its length, however, the content was usually manageable and mostly interesting. A couple of the weeks, the lectures are quite lengthy and dense while others were a bit dry. Also, I think the week about bacteria could use a little more explanation. I feel as though I didn't really understand those concepts until watching that week's as well as the next week's lectures. Finally, the quiz questions for the third to last week were a bit confusing and didn't match well to what the instructors actually said.",4

I felt the presentation of some of the information a bit overwhelming, pure lecture without any visuals.As a suggestion, I think it would have been interesting to hear the presenters talk about their own personal journey/story with respect to meditation, even if it is purely academic without any practical implication for them personally.Many, many thanks!!",4

105633,"Overall, this was an excellent course and, for the beginner, a great foray into general entrepreneurship concepts and ideas. Here's why I say that:1) The professors offering the course are apparently top-notch - they all have extensive and varied experiences with entrepreneurship, and many of them have published research and reports that can be found with a quick google search.2) The amount and nature of the content make it so that it's easy to approach the course more like a workshop, than some static didactic. For example, one of Ethan Mollick's talks comes with a spreadsheet to help students think a little more concretely and specifically about their ventures.3) The course passed no judgement on push vs. pull ventures; they really tried to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each. With the business community's surge in interest in design-thinking, I had been under the false impression that a push venture, by definition, was inferior.I gave 4 instead of 5 stars, however, because I feel that more attention could have been devoted to more service-oriented or product and service hybrid businesses (though the professors didn't totally ignore the service-oriented business). Also, I was under the impression that the professors would have some degree of real-time interaction with students (although I get that they are super busy), or that even if the professors themselves couldn't respond, that a teacher's assistant or representative would comment on questions raised about the course content.Again, this is overall a fantastic course, though not perfect - I would still highly recommend it to anyone thinking about entrepreneurship!",4

25439,very good course! the final was much more logical than the first course,4
15954,"The videos were ok, reading materials added some value, although about three years have passed since the launch of the original course and the materials are all the same. I expected that something new would be introduced to give it a bit more value. But what is very questionable is the architecture of the quizzes. On one hand it goes way beyond the simplicity of the lenght of the course, assume a mindset that extends well beyond this course, and on the other hand after doing the quizzes some times and observing the considered right and wrong answers, some of them - to say the least, are highly ambiguous and express a personal point of view of the instructor in what is right or wrong (what by itself is not very reasonable), and lack ultimately in objectivity regarding the materials covered. I am not by any means saying that the quizzes are hard or simple, I am saying that they lack objectivity and go beyond the scope of the materials and try to put the student on a state of trying to guess what the instructor's opinion is regarding the question at hand. In some cases the 'best' answer chosen is absurd. Highly questionable this approach. Again, I believe that evaluations should be challeging, but these quizzes are a bit esoteric, they lack objectivity.Nonetheless, it is important to say thank you for being present in this platform and having the will to put it together. I wish you luck for the future.",2

97475,"Material was very good and well structured.I think that one main issue is the assignment. We would need much more info/hard facts to make it much more interesting (i.e. less theoritical).Moreover, assignments are reviewed by people 1/ who did not necessarily went through the 2 previous courses 2/ did not see our previous documents ie for course 1 and 2 3/ did not necessarily understand the question (one person complained because I did not answer the question ""edgy vs. conservative"" => I guess she was misled by the support info which were the same as for the first course).This problem could be avoided by offering a distinct case for each assignment, so that there is no confusion/mis-match.In any case, ""mange tak"" for all your courses. I went through 3 so far, and the ones from CBS are clearly the best I had (videos - content and speed - slides/ support documents, quizzes).",3

77963,"Dr. Chuck makes the course quite simple. At the beginning of the course, he patiently introduces some preparing steps such as python installation and screenshot tools, which is quite useful for students with little computer knowledge. During the course, Dr. Chuck manages to use the simplest language to explain the concepts. The slides use different colors to differentiate different elements in a script, indicating Dr. Chuck's consideration for the students. The course reminds me of the sentence from The Zen of Python, ""simple is better than complex.""The course is a beginning course for python. I studied Visual Basic in my freshman year, and now, three years after VB, I found the assignments quite easy. So I advise that if you have prior knowledge of other languages, you can use the book provided by Dr. Chuck to quickly understand the concepts and view some example code. Then you can directly jump to the assignments and I suppose that it would not be too hard for you.I heard MOOC one year ago and enrolled several courses at Coursera. However, this is my first finished course. Sometimes the network speed of the school was too slow to view the videos and this really slowed me down. I also had some school work and exams. Now I am at the end of my undergraduate study and have enough time to take MOOCs. $310 is quite expensive for me but I hope I can accomplish the five courses of this specialization and some day I'll come back to pay for the certification.Thanks to Dr. Chuck and mentors.Tao.ZhengHuazhong University of Science&Technology, P.R.China",4

93423,"Poor quality. A disappointing experience.The lectures are very basic, thought for people that have no experience in programming. This might be ok, but the difficulty of assignments should follow; instead, they can be relatively hard; newbie programmers will probably have an extremely hard time solving them, considering that many of the problems they will encounter are not treated at all in the course.The course does not focus enough on what differentiates R from other languages: just a few videos on data types, *apply functions, and a tiny little bit of scoping (very unclear). All these areas should have been expanded, and the course should have had more arguments as well.Finally, the assignments are not enough and their grading system is quite poor: instead of submitting your code and testing it automatically, you should calculate some quantities by hand and select the results out of a few possibilities.All in all, I was disappointed with the course.",2

This is the first MOOC I managed to finish, and now I'm actively exploring all the extra resources and videos from the course.I originally enrolled looking for tips on how to make my courses more accessible for my students (I'm a college instructor), and also to help me hone my learning skills, since I'm starting to delve on different fields of study. Not only did I achieve those goals, but I'm also very excited to explore new MOOCs and online study possibilities.The only downside, if one could say such, is that this course sets quite a high bar in how a MOOC should be: one can easily percieve that everything about its format -- from the weekly newsletter to the videos' length and visuals to the structure and syllabus -- is made with careful consideration of the context of online learning, and of the fundamentals of neuroscience the course shares with the students. Many (good!) MOOCs aren't as well tailored as this one.I absolutely recommend it to anyone who is interested (even if frustrated!) with learning, be it independently, online or in a traditional classroom environment.

97265,It lacks exercises but other than that this course is pretty fun and interesting. I would definitely recommend it.,4
33874,This video lectures are very clear and well made. I learned the concepts of designs and new ways of thinking.,5
79280,Quite useful and interesting. But not fully live up to my expectations !,3
6586,I really enjoyed this course and got a lot of personal growth out of it. The variety of the presenters and the scope of the information was very engaging and enlightening. Kudos to all involved with this course material!,5
94032,A great way to learn about recruitment and selection. Full of interesting resources,5

86901,Great,5
65588,Amazing course!,4
76186,Awesome and and inspiring. This course is perfect for newbies.,5
29982,Very interesting course that provides a very insightful overview of the international energy issues. I like the way it is structured and how much of valuable information is given (taking into account relatively not big time commitment). I work in the electric power industry and I find information that I have learned during this course to be very helpful for my general understanding of the international energy issues.,5
15332,Excellent course easy to understand and very practice evaluation,5
100392,The course is very good.,5
24384,"The lectures weren't always easy to follow but the quizzes were really useful as they meant it was necessary to understand the material. Definitely a useful course, I will be interested to see how it relates to the real world of derivatives pricing.",3
67044,"The course is super interesting. However, the lectures could be better explained and the material better organized. I found myself constantly looking online for extra material to better understand the concepts. Also, you can tell that the course is not anymore groomed and there are some mistakes in a quiz due to lack of care. In any case, the course is very recommendable to start with neural networks",3
193,"The course itself is good. Nevertheless, it says that it doesn't require any previous experience... But there is actually experience required on financial statements and concepts.",3
52050,Very interesting topic !!!,5
78026,very good course for beginers,5
58819,Best course on ML there is.,5
100129,"Great course!!, the concepts and techniques are very usefull and simple to apply",4
42745,"I absolutely loved this course--it's fun, a confidence-booster, and it has completely changed the way I study and think about the world around me. I love that it takes concepts that would normally be intimidating, such as 'neural pathways', and 'diffuse and focus modes', and puts into them simple terms, like ""pin ball paths"" and ""zombies"". I've learned why certain chemicals in the brain react the way they do, and what stimulates them, and how to better plan and learn the subjects I'm taking. This course also has special tips for those learning science, algebra, and languages, as well as how to better prepare for tests, and how to take breaks efficiently. This course works for all ages and levels; middle school to college, and all subjects, from music theory to chemistry. Do yourself a favor and enroll. You will not regret it.",5
1932,Awesome course,4
69175,"Absolute gem! challenging and rewarding, makes you really go for what you know.",5
42495,It was informative and fun,5
3725,"Great course,great instructor. It could benefit from a discussion board.",5
92804,There is a huge disconnect between the lectures and what is asked in the homework assignments.,1
75409,"This course is definitely designed for someone new to programming and python. I came from a background of programming already, but wanted to know more about Python. I think the lecture material and the way it was presented was great, and I feel like this course would benefit new programmers.",5

44271,Great way to start learning via Coursera or any MOOC.,5
96505,Nice and helpful course,5
92049,"Thank you, Dr. Severance and the Coursera team. This was a great course on using databases with Python!",5
96977,i think it is wonderful work ;i'm really proud of it and it will help me in the following days.thanks,5
86232,"Very helpful and inspiring course. Dr. McGarrity with a great sense of humor give all the support needed to get over your fears, to stand up in front of a lens, and to deliver a self-confidence speech. But more important, he gives a great example and guideline on how to prepare it. Highly recommended MOOC.",4
53738,"This was a great intro into Machine Learning. My only complaint is that it was very heavy in mathematical theory. While that is a necessity for the industry, I would have liked to see more examples of practical applications and implementations with modern technologies and libraries.",4
19876,"Thank you so much for such a fun and well done course. The material is very well structured and learning is done progressively. The professor is such a master of his subject and a great orator that it was very pleasant just listening to. A lot of insights, quotes, examples, suggestions are made and it really helped me learn and retain new knowledge.I would highly recommend this course, even just by itself. For future or current managers.Thanks for sharing this knowledge!",5
26969,"A course without tedious learning of tags, styles, properties and js commands that tries to give you an overview of developing front end of a single page web app.",5
7445,I ve never expected that the lessons would be so understandable and adjustable with my difficult programme! thank you!,5
42744,"This topic should be taught as early as possible to students. Some of the more technical explanations made me get a bit lost, but the summaries and practical tips make this course so worth it.",5
11329,I'm loving it although the written part is very difficult. I won't give up. :),5
6029,"Excellent course. It gives you the essentials of the Canvas model, being very practical and useful",5
99265,Good... Perfect for who needs Complete Understanding,5
9361,"Dr Fowler is very enthusiastic, which is one of the most notable and best things about this course. Although some reviews complain that he over-explains things, I personally found this really helpful - you are taught not just how to do the calculations, but how they work fundamentally, which for me is a pretty important thing if I am to fully understand. The course is slightly above my level in some aspects, but I managed to pass with 100%, which I am very proud of! I'd say some basic knowledge of Calculus helps, but even if you are only just learning, I'd say this is set out in such a way that one could pick it up alright from this course. Only complaint is the sometimes glitchy quizzes, although the forums often say if there are any and how to get around them.Overall, I do recommend this course!",5
64056,It is a wonderful course and understanding is made simple.,4
56932,"A good course for somebody generally versed in computer science, yet with no machine learning experience.",5
37591,The instructor goes in depth and he has a way of explaining the material very clearly.,5
63902,It was fun! We can take the course without buying MATLAB software. The course provides web-MATLAB interface.,5
68511,Instructors are presenting this topic very well.,5
26177,"I loved it. I learned a ton about making games and I learned it by doing it. So, I have two games and a media simulation to show for it.Unity was covered. However, 3D modelling, illustration, and audio were not really taught (but a little bit, in theory.) I think it somewhat has to be like this, unfortunately. For me, I used Blender, Photoshop, and Fruity Loops to create my assets, but mostly just the game development is handled in this course. I'm only saying this, because you should know this upfront, really, which I didn't.Looking forward to the next class...",5
75883,A nice course for beginners. And what's better than get a certificate from one of top Universities in the world! :),4

95256,"Hard course, but good ROI.",5
52813,An excellent training program.,5
36063,"One of the best classes I've ever engaged in. Clarity is exceptional and the questions are direct and to the point. Thank you, Professors of Law at the University of Leiden. Definitely interested in applying to a possible PH.D program.",5
50708,"Useful course aimed mostly for beginners, but quiz questions are formulated with ambiguity making it frustrating to answer since you end up reading between lines trying to avoid traps instead of putting your mind to work towards using the knowledge given by the course",4
91883,One of the best courses of the whole specialization.,5
65193,Nice and comfortable dive into world of Ruby on Rails. Very pleased!,5
73466,"Clear, easy to understand, and with great lectures. Highly recommend.",5

59278,Very good course.,5
68978,"This course was simple. Since it is intended as an overview of few machine learning techniques used to build computer based rational agents it has completely fulfilled my curiosity about what intelligent applications can be built using machine learning algorithms. Professors Emily Fox and Carlos Guestrin did an excellent job of presenting the course in an engaging way and with enough hands-on exercises to better understand the lessons.I am excited to take the next specialization courses to better understand the inner workings of each algorithm, and perhaps manage to understand why these algorithms work the way they do, specially the Deep Learning algorithms.Thank you Coursera for the opportunity and thank the Professors Emily and Carlos for such a valuable gift of sharing knowledge for free.",4
81175,"I think the best part of this course is its diversity. The course is so well structured that theories of several important school of economics are discussed, with their applications in the history.",4
24097,Very complex but clear enough to facilitate learning and skill development.,5
42361,Very good module. I'm glad of being participating on this journalism program. The platform is a breeze and the instructors from the Michigan State University School of Journalism have prepared an entertaining and very informative course. I'm happy!,5

14852,Precise and perfectly executed.,5
33868,"Great, very clear lessons. Kind of easy in a way but I learnt some basic things.",5
24164,A step in the right direction.,5
99766,It's ok. Reading the top three books on time management would take less time and provide far more insight and inspiration.,2
6898,Maybe the best course I have taken so far. Very interesting subject great professor and perfect distribution of content. Would like to see another course by professor Murayama in the future.,5
73743,The course it taught a very simple manner. I have taken other courses online and by far this is the best course for Python I have taken.,5
21938,"Actually, very interesting and helpful class. The one area around more complex structures (API, XML) warrants more attention, since I assume those are more dominant access methods.",4
47125,"Mandatory class for anyone and everyone. In college, post-grad, elementary school, life long learning, this course is open to all. The material is clearly and simply explained. Providing life changing skills and habits.",5

39095,"This is a really good beginner's JavaScript class. If you're starting from scratch, start here.",5
71116,Great course,5
29505,"It's a great course, clear explanations and simple videos.The missing star was lost on the way that misleading or undefined bias are presented, especially during the different decision phases.I would like to propose to discuss a case of a stock share in a timeline, to see whether this ""panic"" or ""overconfidence"" applies, and also in global macroeconomics (e-g. the PIGS bubble, the debt bubble)",4
52817,i like this course.,5
8490,I wish to thank you for such a fantastic course to introduce to the exciting world of Big Data. The concepts were explained beautifully with relevant examples. A special thank you note for Prof Altintas and Prof Gupta for making this so simple.Looking forward to the next set of courses to explore Big Data in detail.,5

19321,Perfect course,5
92013,Interesting!,5
103649,An Informative Introductory course.,4
26807,"This course is an outstanding introduction to Web design technologies and tools. As a backend developer, I was looking for a course to refresh my knowledge of HTML and CSS, and this course went far beyond what I had hoped to learn -- even introducing me to some new tools, as well as filling in a lot of the background of WHY things work the way they do. My only criticism might be that the final week's assignment was not very difficult, and perhaps as a result, didn't force me to really study the material. Otherwise, I highly recommend this course, and I'm looking forward to taking the Angular course in this series. Thank you very much, Yaakov, and Johns Hopkins!",5
77736,good one and nice way to learn!!,5
26040,The course meterial was state of the art. As a software development engineer I know a bit of OpenGL and I personally found it interesting to see how much is really covered in Unity already so that you can really focus on game flow more than on nitty details of trail rendering for example.,5
76387,"Accessible and enjoyable. Professor is very affable, and the material is solid.",5
58103,it was very interesting but more hands on will be better.,4
20523,"Good content, but way too slow. Please use pdf instead of writing everything.",4
65113,An example of how a course should look like. It has everything you need to learn :1) good videos2) good materials3) a teacher that is active on the forum4) very well explained projects5/5 would recommend :DGoing of to listen second part of this specializations.,5
3675,"Compared to the previous 2 courses, this one seemed to have been made in rush. Not enough materials covered, nor enough Java practice opportunity. The course title is misleading because it does not cover any other data structures but graph.",3
52645,Its good way to master in programming because in this course explain more and practically so its more useful to understand.,5
8953,Course help for people who want to be develop their career.,5

30735,A great course with a good explanation of the material.,4
39939,This course is amazing one. Take it if you want to learn jazz improvisation,5
83065,This course probably the only best of class course available online. Prof Daphne Koller is one of the very few authority on this subject. I am glad to sign up this course and after completing gave me a great satisfaction learning Graphical Model. I also purchased the book written by Prof. Koller and Prof Friedman and I am going to continue my study on this subject.,5
103747,I'm not sure who this course was aimed at since there was a heavy use of technical vocabulary to describe many things someone with that level of vocabulary should know. I already knew most of the course material but I learned some new things as well. It would have been one star less but it being a short course which only took me a few hours to complete made me enjoy the experience more,4
90610,"I wouldn't recommend this course to my worst enemy. There is 0 commitment from the TA and mentor staff. After 4 weeks of course, not a single reply from any of them in the forums.To make matters worse, the material is very superficial and lacking, the biggest proof of that is that each module is composed of about 4 videos of 5 minutes each! How can you learn anything in 5 minutes? The topics are so complex, there is simply no way to convey their message in just about 5 minutes. I had to search a lot outside of this course to grasp something of the topics covered. Actually, I found way better explained videos on youtube for free.The assignments of this course are poorly developed and don't reflect what is discussed in the videos well. I repeat myself, the study material was very lacking and consequently not enough for the assignments themselves. I had to spend days coding, debugging and reverse engineering the assignment files to finally be able to pass because they were wrong! They were incomplete and had wrong information. This is not a reverse engineering course... I shouldn't need to do that. Anyway, I did it because there was also no help from any TA to guide me in the right direction.Long story short, you are way better off checking the syllabus of this course and checking videos on youtube to learn about them, you'll learn way more than with this money grabber course.",1
4546,"It has a lot of problems, including: Not so many lectures about excel itself - most of the time you will be watching videos about statistic methods. The lectures are very superficial, even though the quizzes and projects demand a lot of knowledge and time. The course seems to have a staff of one man: the professor of the course rarely replies (even though he did at the beginning of the session) and all the work seems to be done by his assistant, who tries his best, but ends up not coping with all the questions asked at the discussion forums.",2
77237,Great teacher. I really like how he shows you the process and how to think like the computer in order to solve the procedures. Feel it's a great starter!,5
12561,"EXCELENTE CURSO, ES UNA GRAN HERRAMIENTA PARA RE AFIRMAR CONOCIMIENTOS, ADEMAS UNA AYUDA PARA QUIENES QUEREMOS CONSTRUIR UNA VIVIENDA, SUPER PRACTICO, BASTANTE DIDÃCTICO Y PARA NADA DIFÃCIL, UTILIZAN UN LENGUAJE COMO PARA PODER ENTENDER DE QUE SE ESTA HABLANDO.100%RECOMENDADO",5

26035,Was hard to keep up with work as well.,4
84206,"Very good course, it's worth trying!",5
21962,"The project at the end requires actions that data scientists should know but does not actually talk about the items. For example the project ""book"". You hear about it but are not actually taught the right way to make one. At best case you are taking a guess and at worst you are learning bad habits or missing out on what should be in it.",2
33414,What tutor said is articulate. What tutor taught is easy to understand. What assignment asked to do is useful. This is a easy but practical course.,5

37885,pretty good,5
18622,Pretty useful entry-level course!,4
74742,Very Good beginner course,5
62157,"Great course, I liked the way each lecture is presented (general overview of each concept; academic insights; practical recommendations) and having a deep and thorough look at how ""digital"" is impacting ""marketing"" is so important that is usually overlooked. People just move to specific metrics and practices, but such a revolutionizing way of dealing with marketing deserves this broad and deep look so one can fully comprehend what is going on.",5
64435,"Very overwehelming with lots of names and without explanation, just like real lection in real university.",3
84743,Wonderful course. Interesting professor. Useful content.,5
77862,Great. Simple. Very relatable!,5

41995,Handy and Informative,3
97309,I'd recommend this course to anyone who wishes to teach English. I've enjoyed its creativity and the way the professors have taught throughout the entire course. It deserves ten stars not just five. Great job !,5
35719,This was better than the previous courses in that it gives more concrete information about where to find help in format and research needs. This makes it easier to apply and give feedback to other students.,4

24358,It's a very nice course for those of you who interested in financial engineering. Highly recommended,5
34293,A little light in terms of depth but very well structured and clearly presented.,4
69090,"I love the case-based method and the focus on the practitioner. Almost every other competing course and textbook puts too much focus on the mathematics proofs, on the nuts and bolts of the algorithms. I also like the informal attitude of the instructors.The dependence on Dato, and the fact that Dato does not have a student or home use pricing are bad. After learning all of this, am I supposed to buy software that costs US$ 400 per month (matlab has a student edition for a one time price of $90)Continuem o excelente e inspirador trabalho!

5090,The course is quite informative and educative for a non-statistical person like me. The instructors were explaining complex concepts in a very simpler manner. Except that the use of data camp for R could have been replaced with the exercises done on R (offline) and submitted through the quiz. The quizzes were really good.,4

103014,The course gives a great overview as well as a deeper introduction to SEO,5
82787,"The course was nice but not structured very good, especially week 4. From time to time you have a feeling that this course is more like a compilation of lectures made for other courses with similar topic. Especially confusing are moments when during the lecture author references previous materials you expected to know from lectures you've never heard. That's strange.",4

59533,Great course! Great teacher! There are so many interesting topics within course and many challengeable programming assignments! I adore it!,5
76104,Too expensive to be that simple.,2
49139,"This was a good course, but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests. I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before. I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the ""lecture notes"" were not always very helpful. So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities. In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students. I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3

22790,Test for module 2 had questions that weren't part of the course (about programming). I think it was a kind of error in coursera configuration.,4
79994,"Excellent lectures and material, thank you!",5
20612,"I learned a lot from this class, but I had a difficult time with some of the multiple choice quizzes, which I think could be improved. I felt that the additional materials (PDF readings) could have done a better job explaining concepts like risk ratios, rate ratios, and odds ratios, among others. I hope the teachers of the class consider revising and improving the lectures and readings for clarity.",4
15622,"Typically writing courses deal with either the business of writing, or the pretentious art and literature side of writing. Almost nobody deals with the science of writing. Where is the talk on motivational arrows? Character likabilities like being unrelenting? Where is the meta-analysis of good techniques in writing? meta-data is the future of defining the science of writing, but it's not mentioned here even slightly. What about will he/won't he moments? Backstory interacting and being relevant to the plot? What about fish out of water? This course doesn't even touch upon foundational pillars and tenets that make good writing. I couldn't imagine paying for this course, since I've already paid too much with my time. As it stands, I could have taught a better course than this, and maybe some day I'll be so fortunate as to move writing studies in the right direction, towards the truth that older generation teachers are unwilling to accept: that good writing is empirical, and therefore can be learned.",4
103817,"As a professional Instructional Designer, I can attest that this is the poorest-designed course I have ever seen. Regrettably, I paid for the entire specialization up-front, and I cannot get a refund or even a Coursera credit for enrolling in a different specialization.Be aware that the faculty who is the instructor of record does not participate in the course. The video lectures are poorly done, including errors and misstatements that could have been edited out, but it appears that no one bothered to edit the raw footage before uploading it.There is not so much instruction as an overview. There are no coding exercises until the final assignment, which is poorly-described and requires the student to self-teach using outside sources.There are app specializations in Coursera that appear much better-designed. Look elsewhere.",1

97778,Thank you so much.,5
97067,"The content in this course is a very good introduction to educational theory and practice.There is just one aspect I philosophically disagree with, yet this is a pivotal point in education. The course assumes that Education is a way to change behaviour (as an external factor)Yet I am more inclined to the philosophy of: Education is to lift man up from the animal state; and by this uplift man will change his own relationship with the world (internal factor).The theory and practice given in this course are still valuable though, regardless of this difference in viewpoint.",4
9126,It is very good course and give a better understand in calculus.,4
17937,Good and interesting project.,4
21068,"The course can be informative, but the presentation needs some work. All of the instructional videos were merely a person reading a Power Point presentation to the viewer. The ""in class"" examples appeared to be completely hypothetical and were also read to the viewer without any video demonstration of how the presented information works in an actual class.In addition, the written information in the videos was confusingly organized and had not been fully edited. In multiple videos, there were typos. In at least one video, the instructors had not fully deleted the sentences from a previous version of a slide. When the revised slide was presented to the viewer, a word from a previous version was in the middle of the sentence. In addition, the previous version was obviously about a different subject.I was disappointed and continually frustrated with this course, especially since the instructors required me to pay fifty dollars in order to take the module quizzes and the final assessment. I have no problem paying for a good product. However, the professionalism displayed in the course was incredibly lacking.",2
55708,One of the best introductory course to machine learning!,5
55133,"Andrew Ng is one of the best teachers out there, he made it a point to really make concepts sound simple enough for a layperson to understand, very simple explanation of concepts is what kept me going. I really liked this course.The support forums and Tim Mosher deserve a special mention - whenever I got stuck with my assignments I would look to the test scenarios available to test my coding, it really helped me to complete the course especially with the assignments.I will not say that I am a master of machine learning now, but I am definitely more equipped and with experience I will get much better using the skills and techniques that I learned in this course",5

I also like the quizzes and the interactive checker we have for checking our code. Sometime I'm working off my phone and can't access a python interactive environment until I get home from work.z",5
15601,"As much as I enjoyed completing this course, as I've enjoyed every course in this program, this one feels less organised than the others simply in that the learning material doesn't clearly connect with the writing material and it was difficult to predict what the review criteria might be. I found myself guessing at the meaning of each week's modules before completing my assignments and more often than not I discovered little correlation between the videos and assignments.",3

78255,"The course was very easy if you got prior knowledge in programming in any other programming language. However this was a pretty good introduction to Python. I'm wondering why you are still teaching Python 2, when most people are already using Python 3 already. I've seen there are major differences between Python 2 and 3, most examples learned here would give Syntax error in Python 3.I think this used to be an older course, recorded several years ago. That's why Python 2 is being used. Python 3 is pretty much mature now.",4

95895,"The course outline is very good, however the presentation (especially the slides) can be monotonous. The usage of various system engineering terminologies and jargon can be intimidating at times. Appreciate the instructors intention of keeping the videos and material very digestible on a weekly basis, I would suggest them to include more case studies and activities, from the professional realm as well. I would also suggest them to bring in the awareness of various tools that are used throughout the systems engineering process.

11619,Learn something about the money supply and demand and their relationship with the exchange rate. but can hardly used in daily,3
19175,Lots of information; well-organized & well presented.,5
61640,The course offers a good mix of media used for the lectures. The book that accompanies the course is worth reading. The assessments and quizes are good to handle when completing all lectures and readings.The course requires some pre knowledge.,4

77093,Brilliant Course. Would recommend to anyone who wants to learn from scratch,5
78969,Great introductory course towards statistics,5
28274,Really good course. I would have given it 5 stars but it could use a little improvement. Too many optional assignments perhaps. They should have been required. The class just didn't engage you enough. That being said I've signed up for the next ones.,4
69710,Good as a standard introduction to chinese. We learnt similar words in our first-semester course at uni.I'd personally also like to learn the simplified chinese symbols but that's just my opinion.Weekly deadlines are good but if we keep going I won't revise anything. I'd rather have the course force me to repeat some of the words and constructs I have learnt in former courses. The assignments should be harder too.,4
12702,"Very interesting, very informative!",5
99961,I highly recommend this course. There are some specific tips for improving your efficiency and it supported by some real life ex,5
11722,Very easy to digest and very informative,5
81180,"Very interesting and well delivered material, that gives understanding of what macroeconomics is even to those who have had no idea of what it is before.",5
80344,"This course was extremely valuable to me. Theoretical knowledge especially. My two points for possible improvement, most probably subjective, would be:1.The course is too slow-paced. There is a bit too much of an auxiliary talk, which may distract from the essential knowledge.2.While the course offers some state of the art practical examples, a little more interactive approach would probably immensely increase student involvement and hence help keep attention and distinguish important points.Lastly, at every start of the week, I was asked to do a test quiz to asses my knowledge from that week. This is very strange. The test quizzes should most definitely be offered only in the end of a week, AFTER I have acquired knowledge, and not before.",4
5764,everything is great exept last week,4
10853,"this course is pretty thorough as far as data sampling goes. The professor is clearly very well versed in the statistical methods. This course is mainly about statistical methods used in the field of biodiversity, so at the end, you will have to use the formulas mentioned in lectures (without any worked examples), so if you are not comfortable with calculus, it's not for you. The transcripts are helpful but often incomprehensible.",4
21042,I really enjoyed studying with Lund University. I am specially satisfied by learning more about EU legal system.,5
957,Very good course in algorithms. I bought the book to help me understand but the lectures make it way easier and thus much more fun to understand the analysis. Looking forward to complete the spec,5
93284,"This course is not set up right, the assignments ask you to do things that aren't explained until the next weeks content, its kind of discouraging. In the end, it does teach you the basics of R, its just too bad that the way to get there is aggravating.The reason I still only give it 2 stars is because of the quality of the courses itself. There are many, many 1 and 2 minute videos, these could've easily been combined. The teacher seems unprepared in his lectures, he stutters and repeats a lot and makes a weird noise between slides. This shouldn't be necessary with pre-recorded lectures. The assignments and quizzes are also poorly written and contain spelling and sloppy mistakes, which doesn't make sense because the material isn't new. It all just makes it seem like the teacher doesn't really care and just wants to sell the course to a lot of people without putting in much effort.If you are not following the specialization I would not advise this course for beginners. I'm quite surprised to see the course get such high ratings.",2
87386,Great Course,5
52339,waste of time and money,1
43388,"Everyone would have their own approaches/tools to learning. I feel that this course would help one to confirm if the approaches/tools they use is really helping them ? And also, it would help one to equip with several more approaches that others in the world use for learning. Keep learning!",5
14083,"Very good course, simple to follow.",5
71274,"Great introduction to functional programming, and you'll get to learn the basics of Scala at the same time. Some of the assignments have a bit cryptic descriptions.",4

38389,Loved this course so much! Thanks to John for informative and interesting lectures. Higly recommend it to all who love rock and would like to have a structured knowledge about its history.,5
80301,"The course is great resource of information. The biggest drawback is the need of using Flash to view most of the lecture. This limited my ability to went through the course on time - I ""attend"" Coursera courses using my iPhone while commuting and it is not possible for this course.",3
95675,This is by far the best course I have taken from Coursera. Orin is very knowledgeable and passionate in his lectures.,5
15594,"I found this course very helpful as a step along the path to improving my writing. I really liked the course director Any Bloom, who has an engaging, calm manner and gave very useful insights into writing about character and creating characters that feel as if they have a life beyond the page. The course is well structured and the assignments well designed to help you to think about point of view and character and I found myself being able to develop a fictional character that I have had in my mind for a while. I really enjoyed the course, thank you very much.",5
81746,"Great course, thanks a lot for your help",5

4537,good course,3
28825,This course is for people who are already relatively happy. Tasks are impossible for those who are not happy. Personally i couldn't define happines and couldn't remember anyone who i am grateful to,2
9334,love the explanation. but it would be highly appreciated if some practice material was provided which would be reviewed by experts after completion.,4

102181,"The course is excellent in many ways. The course material,video is very simple and understandable to a layman also. one need not be an expert.The presentation was superb, leaving no doubt at the end of each week.The course material and video is self sufficient. I am very happy to have joined the course. I would like to complete the rest of the course satisfactorily.

43301,A lot of useful techniques and motivation.,5
27478,In my opinion issues aboard at course are too complex to explained in shorts terms.But the infomation was value enough for an overview approach.Thanks.,3
47880,"I have given this course 5 stars even though I think that there is room for improvement in the videos. At times it feels like I am watching somebody reading slowly from an autocue/teleprompter. Apart from this I would recommend this course to everyone. I would even like to see Coursera have it linked directly to their landing web page. After all, this site is all about learning, and making sure that everybody is approaching the learning process as well prepared as possible is in everybody's best interest (including Coursera and those that create the course material).",5
14070,Great course,4
78172,A fantastic instructor. The course delivers what it says...programming for **everybody** and **getting started** with Python. I liked the gradual way in which topics and concepts were introduced. The exercises were challenging enough to keep me interested and easy enough to solve in the end.,5
64934,"The course is a good general knowledge introduction to Egypt, there is lots of information stuffed into each week. The lecturer's style is super dry, but the lectures are ultimately very useful. This course style is sometimes a bit disconnected, in that the information you are given is often handled purely as information, and not quite as often contextualized. This tends to make the quizzes, and discussion prompts feel disjointed, and challenging in the way that it's difficult to use your newfound knowledge in application. That being said, I really enjoyed the class as a very direct knowledge-gathering experience.",4
95414,"This course is accurately advertised as requiring intermediate programming experience. It focusses on some of the basic python tools that are used in data science like pandas, specifically dataframes. For a python newbie like me, some of the assignments were quite challenging as they required significant additional reading and search. I would have appreciated if all of the concepts required to solve the assignments were introduced in the same week, so my additional reading and search would have been more targeted. Very little stats if any is required or taught.",4
14000,Very intuitive.,5

42450,Awesome course and I really recommend all who have interests on infrastructures.,5
98290,"The course fails to clearly explain how to use so many of the formulas that the professor just glides over in class. The quiz was far harder than it should have been, mainly because the professor failed to properly introduce and teach students to use the formulas.",2
70668,Well taken by the teachers. The bugs in the review system are the only problems I faced.Hope they get rectified soon.,4
54435,"Some quiz questions and parts of the programming assignments seem a bit arbitrary, but the course is solid overall. I'd strongly advise making heavy use of the tutorials and test cases for the programming assignments in the resources section.",4

52653,Great course!,5
12994,"This was the most intense and enjoyable courses I've ever taken. Professor Almeida is simply brilliant. He's the type of academic that marries theory with the real world. He's also a first class academic with some great publications. The course provides a great mixture of analysis and then true-to life case work on companies and deals. Be prepared to work But know that you'll come out of this class with a completely solid knowledge of corporate finance. You can't sit back in the class. He challenges you to work and practice and ask questions. I don't know if I've ever learned as much from one class as I did in this one. One thing, usually I speed up my video lectures but I had to slow down my video feeds with Prof. A.! This is the best business class I've ever had.",5

72205,This course was really interesting. The teacher was engaging and really knew the subject inside and out. I am so happy with all that I learned. My only critique is I don't really like the multiple answers possible in the tests... It's hard to know what you got right and what you didn't. Overall a great course. Thank you!,5
97570,The Course is really good. The presentation is intense and clearly structured. I would specifically emphasize the quality of the required and recommended reading lists.,5

For me as a medical translator it was not only a great learning experience, but also added value to my business. I can only recommend this course to anyone interested in dentistry.",5
87196,"All in all, I liked the class. I would like to learn about this topic and the database access using Python, and I still think this is a very good beginning. I like the enthusiasm of the instructor, but I think he short sells many of the things he is teaching. I would also suggest providing more challenging assignments, for instance, as optional ones. These may be such that they require reading the referred text in addition to watching the videos.",3
58780,Fantastic course. Andrew Ng is a great professor who has the ability to make a complicated subject very simple,5

89522,Nicely explained with easy to understand examples. Quite hard for those who have never studied research methods. Very dense information. I found one or two questions in the weekly quiz that I couldn`t answer with the knowledge available in the videos.,4
67532,Very Good in depth explanation and hand-on lab machine learning course. very focused on real world analytics and algorithms,5
16037,Each week was only about an hour. Most MOOC courses I've taken have at least 3 to 4 hours of content and learning. Very little learning for a 4 week course. This is a 1 week course stretched out to 4 weeks.,2

99508,"Really good lessons, well ordered and with coding examples for everything. The subjects may seem overwhelming at moments, but I believe that's due to the nature of AngularJS and it's steep learning curve. The assignments are interesting and challenging, and the support provided by the TA is great.Yaakov adds a pinch of humor that makes the course easier to traverse. 100% recommended.",5
39543,Very nice and exciting course. The security part is very important and promising. Thanks.,5

73224,"Very much enjoyed the course and the discussions (particularly on healthcare policy). However, the title should reflect that the course is entirely US-centric.",4
90854,"Not well prepared and not well explained. They throw formulas at you and read it aloud instead of explaining the nature behind those.They change notations every lecture, sometimes in the same lecture. It's easy but these things made it artificially dificult.At least it's better than the next one in the specialization",2

18773,I graduated with a BS in computer science and mathematics 15 years ago. Since then I've been working as a Business Intelligence consultant and I've recently decided to look into the field of Data Science. I was looking for a math class to refresh my math skills rather than start from scratch and this was the perfect course for that. Kudos to Daniel Egger for creating the class. It saved my a lot of time.,5
21870,The best course so far (though that's not saying much). This course would be better as a follow up to an example workflow showing an end to end analysis.,3
9431,The course has rekindled my passion for math!,5

20441,"Instructor was very enthusiastic about the course, I thought it was well structured and it's good to get a framework for things. As someone who came in as pretty conservative leaning on the Environmental issue, it helps me become more knowledgeable about why the EPA can do the things it can, and a better understanding of how environmental law works. More information is always better!",4

65227,"Compared to other courses I have completed on Coursera, this is one of the most confusing ones so far",3
96531,"Great class, the professor has a rather interesting sense of humor which actually makes the whole experience more enjoyable. The assignments are challenging enough to make sure you learn, but are still doable within the allotted time. One recommendation from me is to use the same tools he uses in the videos (such as Brackets) as it becomes a bonus to get familiar with new development tools.",5
8706,Great learning experience.,5

10888,Cover very broad range of topic,5
11734,Thank You Indy for a most challenging Course. I have taken >25 coursera courses and I would have this one is the most challenging. The C++ development project really strengthens your Computer-to-Computer Protocol Communication ability. Five stars all the way.,5
32678,"I had fun and enjoyed this class, do the work and you will learn alot.",5
22997,good course a bit hard to understand at times the information can get confusing but the it is there wish they would add printable bulletins at the end so make information readable just for extra help with the understanding of the material,3
19641,"I cannot say much about the content, as I`m not a native speaker and can`t really decide about the quality of the language used.I really appreciate that we have the possibility to join online-classes but this courses made me have mixed feelings.1) I missed a proper Introduction - even tho Week 1 had a brief Introduction, I felt from the beginning like I was thrown in thr middle of a class starting somehwere2) The animated clips are quite nice, but the power point presentations were really old-fashioned. I think it might look more professional if there`d be a modern design as well.3) The teachers are quite difficult to rate. But I actually felt like in point one, even tho I was listening and understand what they were talking about, I didn`t felt related to any certain situation or example. Again, I felt like joining a class in the middle of the course.4) Writing some words big, some words small. In Titles/Headlines I understand that, but why do they write words like ""Negative or Highly Sensitive"" big within a text or in another text ""negative or highly sensitive"" ? There are no things like nouns in english most of the times, so why? That doesn`t look really professional to me.5) Lessons mentioned that didn`t seem to happen, like in week 2 or week 3 they referred to a previous lesson which never happend?6) Paying for the Quiz. I understand I joined the free audit and I`m really thankful to have access to all the material. But reviewing a quiz without paying would be useful even for people who don`t pay. As I`d love to know which things I did correct or which words I could use instead.",3

48314,I have learned how to learn :D,5
58513,Great course. Andrew Ng conveys concepts in one of the most articulate and elegant ways I have ever experienced with any teacher.,5
69028,"This is the introductory course to a series of courses designed to teach machine learning through case studies. The introductory course provided a nice overview of key machine learning techniques in the context of common applications of machine learning (case studies). The concepts are taught in Python using the high-level DATO GraphLab libraries, so the course provides a good introduction to using the machine learning techniques that are provided in DATA GraphLab rather than on learning the mathematics behind the techniques.I am investigating the capabilities and advantages and disadvantages of existing frameworks such as Pandas and DATO GraphLab, so this course met my needs, but it would probably not be as useful to data scientists who are interested in learning the underlying principles, mathematics and numerical methods used in machine learning.I would have given the course a rating of five IF it had done a better job of describing the fundamental principles of machine learning and if it had made it easier to use a non-commercial framework such as Pandas.I'm planning to take the next course in the series in the hope that it will provide more in-depth coverage of the fundamental principles of machine learning than the introductory course.",4
591,Excellent materials and approach. It was a very useful course.,5

17886,I have been trying to get a job at largest hospital here in PA. I went through an interview process and I let the parties involved know that I was taking a course on medical terminology from PITT. I believe this was a plus and I would like to thank you for such a wonderful course. It was very challenging since I am not familiarized with the healthcare vocabulary but you guys made it easy with the many resources that were provided. I had fun and spent lots of time researching the internet as well.The good news is I got the job and I finished the course just in time because I will be starting my new job soon.

39063,"Excellent. The best course so far in the Specialization. While it obviously can't teach every nuance of Javascript in four weeks, what it can do is give a foundation for further independent learning. I've avoided JavaScript for years despite decades of programming experience in older languages because I just couldn't be bothered getting my head around events and DOM--but now it all seems so straightforward I wish I'd taken the plunge years ago.Nice straightforward step by step guidance to get past the inevitable stumbling blocks and loads of support in the forums from fellow students and staff.",5

104235,"In general the course was really good, I just had the problem that some points weren't as clearly explained as I wished them to be. It's a bit hard to follow up, since sometimes the examples are not what is asked for in the homework and there's nothing to compare your work to, so the student as well as the grading peers are not always sure what is important in the assignment. Add some more examples and explain them directly, I think that would help a lot. :)",4

The subject content, intermixed with relevant movies, flow of the topics, depth and breadth, the way prof. Seamon explains (narrative, style) - all is very good. I'd certainly recommend this course to other students. And, I'll look forward to reading Prof.'s book to understand the topic a bit more. Thanks to all (Coursera, Weslyan U, staff).",5

95919,"It is not easy to teach a methodology, knowing that the students come from very different backgrounds and system domains. The instructors were able to teach the concepts with the right pace and to provide examples which were easy to follow. In my opinion, a key success criterion for the course is the chosen running example: a dwelling. Every student, independent from background and system domain, can relate to it and apply the methodology. Because of the dwelling example, students could review the work of other students and don't get confused by a system domain they don't understand. It is worthwhile to mention that the course material is based on ISO 15288 and ISO 29148. I can highly recommend the course as an introduction to Systems Engineering.",5

92825,"Love Coursera but was disappointed in this course. Being a true beginner w/no background in programming or data science, I felt the programming assignments were way too far a stretch from the Swirl exercises (which I felt were super helpful and beginner appropriate) and lectures. I spent 8-12 hrs on each one just googling and trying to decipher the programming jargon that most responses were written in. I was able to figure out workable code for most problems but I feel like I am still lacking the basic fundamentals underlying the solutions to these assignments and would have a hard time reproducing solutions to similar problems.",2

59563,"Very interesting, easy to follow videos (right level of detail on linear algebra) and lots of algorithms, techniques and tips!For the last lessons, however, the practice is a bit ""black box"" where you have everthing initialized and you just plug in your functions, I'd liked more details on how everything was set.",4
6294,"What an informative course! Your Professors (all women, and which I find very impressive and inspiring) are so knowledgeable, so broad-based, as well as detail-oriented in their quest to bring animal rights to the forefront of worldwide consciousness. I would love to visit University of Edinburgh someday, I'm an alumnus of University of Montana (B.A.) and Gonzaga University (M.A., and Ph.D. candidacy). Thanks so very much for offering this most important course for free and to make it available for certification so that it can be added to any resume.",5
2269,"Very interesting course, better done when in an academic context and with an ongoing project to carry out the exercices for. If you don't have access to a university library, you will be very limited, but the course presents some alternatives for us professionals who are still interested in researching and documenting our work with a more scientific approach.",4

12161,"Unnecessary video segment at the start of each lecture is annoying and a total waste of time. The content of the course lacks in substance compared to the ""An Introduction to American Law"" course. So much time spent on European effect on British law: this is not a course for lawyers, I would presume, but supposed to be an introduction.",2

95754,"Highlight of the course was the interview with the IDEO researcher. It's great that you have actual people from the industry bringing their knowledge to the table, I really liked that.On the other hand, I think the course was in general too easy compared to the academic level of the previous courses of the specialization. Especially the assignments were not requiring the same amount of work / proof. For example conducting interviews would just require some written summary while previous courses required actually to record a full interview to soundcloud. I think the course was especially missing the assignment on prototyping, which would be really important. It was kindof just skipped and we students were not asked to actually build prototypes. I think the course should be harder and request more effort from the students.",4

44427,"This course, the professionalism of the teaching staff and the content impressed me to the extent I sent emails to every thinking person I know. One of my students has done weeks one and two several times.... she is a grade 11 school student and an original thinker. She is the only one that looked at the course and gave me feed back.I am so grateful to be able to learn from great thinkers without feeling that I am one of the world's failures. How very much I do appreciate not being talked down to and being given the time to write down words that I might not know well and, finding that as I learn meanings from an ordinary dictionary, I am able to use those words on a day to day basis. I am also so grateful that I did not have to buy anything either from the University or from needing extra books to understand the course.I have changed several of my home tutoring practices. In fact as it is school holidays here I have been practicing to 'teach' as well as the teachers on this course.My nature is such that I need to thank people for the service they do to others. I wish I could thank you by buying a million certificates. As I am unable to do this or even buy one - what I can do is acknowledge that I learned what I know from the University of California, San Diego and mention the names of those who helped me learn. The other way of saying thank you is to remind my thinking friends that if they wish to avoid loss of their abilities to think rationally, as they age , they could look at the courses available to everyone.Sincerely,Ruth St. ClaireAbu DhabiUnited Arab Emirates",5

I was able to read much of the material provided in teachastronomy, thank you for the kindness of making the material available. I watched all the videos of Professor Chris and I was able to follow well due to the availability of the subtitles in English, this was important. The interviews I could not follow completely by the lack of subtitles. This was a great opportunity for me that likes astronomy, but because of the distance that I live from the great centers of study, it is very difficult to access good and reliable information. I am very grateful and congratulate the institution for making this course available.",5
81089,Nice teaching method and straight foward classes. I recommend it for everyone willing to understand the basics and to get a gut felling about how a country econonomy can perform.,5

64874,"Great Teacher. Great examples. Only issue i did not like what that you had to find a partner to negotiate with and I found it a bit difficult to find people in my time zone who spoke good English.

45984,Very helpful in helping train better memory and more effective ways of studying in by understanding how brain operates.,5
82151,The University of London is amazing. As a person with severe anxiety who is also a full time student I don't have as much time as I would like to focus on these courses but this course was so well compartmentalized and polished that it was a great experience even for me. I really liked how the pace of the assignments is increasing in complexity at a very nice pace. As a person with anxiety peer reviewed assignments can be a very frustrating process people can be petty with peer reviewed assignments I can't convey to them my other learning disabilities.,5

84675,"Again like in Getting Started with Python course, I wish there was a way for us to get explanations for quiz questions after we complete a quiz, so we can fully understand them. I wish we could have something similar for when we complete the coding assignments, the worked exercises are helpful, but it would be helpful after we complete an assignment to have a code to compare ours to, to see the differences and to make sure we understand exactly what Dr. Chuck was getting at. There were several assignments that I completed, but not in the correct way, so the next weeks assignment was more difficult than it should have been.",4
47470,It is an excelent course for learning the principles of how works our brain it also gives some interesting and helpfull tools for learning any subject,5
23478,Excellent course loved the info and the way it was presented. Quick to the point and on par. I wouldn't mind seeing a little more info on seafood and fish in general I've read a few studies and as far as i can tell at this point in the game we've poisoned our oceans tremendously and theres been scientific studies that have found large quantities of highly toxic chemicals in the fish's blood and meat. so thats about the only thing id like to see is going a little deeper into the actual health risks associated with the damage humans have caused to the food we eat from the oceans to GMO's. These seem like hot topics in todays day and age. But like i said i really enjoyed the course and look forward to taking additional courses on nutrition and food prep.,5
78506,"A really good and friendly introductory to not just Python, but programming as a concept in general.",5
66403,Thank you! This course is useful to add my skill!,5

Great course - totally worth it!",5
77639,"wonderful course!! I absolutely enjoy every part of it, so much so that I am planning to continue the course with the specialization that has now become available with the same professor.

99340,"This course is a great walk through guide not only for AngularJS, but also for some general software development best practices. The content is clear and easy to understand even though it does deep dive into several topics (for the good). Last but not least, the presenter found a great sweet spot between a super serious, yet boring lecture and a super cool presentation that doesn't actually teach you anything.",5
26146,"Very enjoyable, and a lot of fun. Instruction is easy to follow, and the workload is quite manageable.On the downside, there is no interaction with the instructor or any course staff on the forums, so if you have any issues, it'll be up to your classmates to help you.",4
96997,Great introduction not only for systematic review but also for scientific research.,5
77926,"It is as stated: Programming for Everybody (who hasnt had any expsoure to programming). If you dont know about computers and you dont know about programming, this course is for you.On the other hand: if you do have a basic understanding of computers and/or programming, than this may no be the right course for you: The beginning is too slow - the stuff about CPUs & memory etc. is really for people who dont know about computers at all. The overall pace is too slow.My suggestion would be toa) shorten the introductiory partb) increase lurning-curve & depthc) add more complex assignments -> maybe as ""bonus assignments""",4

This is a great course for both learners and teachers as it can help in structuring learning and teaching sessions to maximise information retention and the likes.Further to that the tools for learning mentioned in this course are great and are backed by relevant research. This is a great course to do and if you're starting with MOOCs I would suggest this as one of the first courses to take. Thanks Barbara, Mr T and the crew. This was an enjoyable experience.",5

69978,"It's quite a challenge to instill life in the mathematical dryness that is ""Control Theory"", yet somehow Magnus does it. Simply put the lecturer is awesome and that was the main reason I came back week after week. As to how much the taught material be actually useful for my career and robotic hobbyist aspirations still remains to be seen. The main reason I took this course was that my CS studies didn't provide me with any foundation in Control and Estimation and this course definitely helped to fill some problematic gaps in my education.",5

71576,"A wealth of information taught by engaging professors. The interactive peer-review process immediately showed me how I was interpreting the class information and where to focus for best results. Week-End slide shows recap for maximum retention. Instructors used external linked videos for examples that were extremely useful. A real-world company CEO gave us his topic thoughts throughout the course. The course installments were of the optimal length for enjoyment and interest. I was able to utilize the skills on day one and my interest and knowledge base kept growing daily. Each weekly required essay was thought provoking and engaged the core of the values and skills we had learned. 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, A+ I would do it again in a heartbeat.

27601,"Duke University's The Challenges of Global Heath sparked my interest in global heath with informative lectures, compelling interviews, and a charismatic professor leading the way. It is very organized and has great suggested readings and resources all in one easy to reach place. This course lets you learn at your own pace so you won't rush yourself. I knew almost nothing about global heath before taking this course, I have learned so much while enjoying it too. This course has changed the way I look at global heath. I highly recommend taking this course, especially if you have little to no knowledge on the subject. I can almost guarantee that this will get you interested in the challenges of global heath.",5

88090,"The course was very nice and useful and the explanations were very good!The biggest problem of this course was that it required to be purchased in order to unlock the quizzes and the assignments. I don't know who decided to do this (the organizers of this course or Coursera) but I don't think it was a good idea.I was not interested (and I am sure I am not the only one) in receiving a certificate. I just wanted to learn and to test the acquired knowledge.I realize that it is impossible to improve this project without any money, but you can obtain the needed money from other sources (donations, sponsorships) without affecting those who want to learn. Event that the access to the video was not restricted (thus, many knowledge can still be acquired by those who want), the assignments have their important role in the learning process.I saw that I am not the only one who mentioned in the feedbacks the purchasing problem for this course. I hope that these feedbacks will be taken into account and the things will be changed for the next editions of this course.To sum up, the information from this course and the manner of providing this, deserves 5 stars. Because of the purchasing issue, I am giving only one star.",1

45271,What a good lesson.,5
61425,"Very special, good insight and directions to grap digital analysis subjects.",5
103066,"One piece of improvement is to stream line the peer graded assignment. I noticed a slight disconnect between the writing prompt and the grading rubric particularly around the implementation of metrics to track success of content improvement initiatives. What would be wrong to use the grading rubric as a baseline for the writing prompt that can be used as a guideline for student to follow when drafting his response. This would save a lot of back and forth between submitting a blank sheet of work in order to see how the grading is set up, then going back to adjust the original work to make it fit the grading sheet.",4
28075,I'm new in Graphic Design and this course was a great introduction.,5
62492,"Some good case studies and interesting content, but it's a 50,000 foot view of marketing. I was seeking a more technical and channel specific insights. This is much more conceptual and high level, so it was less useful for me.",3

Anybody will benefit from this course, but if you're interested in (cognitive) psychology this really helps with building or expanding your knowledge of subjects like motivation. Personally I've done a Master in Applied Cognitive Psychology, and have read about self-determination theory, but never have I seen it applied so broadly to so many subjects. I feel like I understand my own degree much better now. Not just that; since this course I feel like I understand everything and everyone better now...",5

In contrast this course is so far the best I have seen. Professor Chang caught my attention from the first second. Course is very well structured, lessons and language are easy to understand. Lecture is very interactive, interrupted by short questions to maintain your concentration. Background is changing in order to keep your attention and desire to know more. Learning with prof. Chang is simply great fun!!!",5

69735,"This is a very good course to learn some basic expressions and, most of all, get a good first grasp of Chinese pronunciation. However I found the course structure quite repetitive over the seven weeks: Every other module is structured in the same way: ""Which fruit do you like? Apple, banana, orange..."", then the week after it's ""Which sport do you like? Basketball, cycling, running"". For a seven-week course this was not challenging enough. But it's a good start.",3

59435,"I have tried and tested multiple courses on machine learning. This course's USP is the in-detail theoretical treatment of the machine learning algorithms with a focus on quick prototyping using a simple language such as Octave. Don't get me wrong - For my purposes, I always prefer Python to R and R to Octave. R and Python might have great ML libraries, but if you wish to get your hands dirty with the engineering behind those algorithms, the build, that is - then Octave is great!. I think it's a much needed skill, to understand the design of these algorithms in greater detail. It's a more liberating experience than being reliant on limited degrees of freedom provided by some packages in R or Python.",5

While I fully agree with the premise of the course, the importance of leadership communication through storytelling, this course presented no sources, psychological research, or evidence to defend its arguments. It provided great ""lay advice"" with little to no research base. I would not recommend this course for anything beyond casual reading. It is not substantiated.",2
14140,Great start. The textbooks are most valuable. The 101 on Github is a little bare bones and could use an update.,5

2377,"Feels underwritten by the DEA, and aimed at perhaps high school students? Very slow pace; info could've been distilled into less than half the lectures (I completed the '7 weeks' in 3 days). Doesn't really distinguish between users without serious problems & addicts (which I believe amplifies gateway effects & experimentation once people meet users who aren't brain damaged or addicts). Creates an exaggerated and arbitrary distinction between prescribed drugs as all good and recreational as all bad, and dismisses any possible benefits of substances that are not legal, noting only that medical marijuana has been helpful for HIV patients, which is certainly an understatement. Components are also helpful for cancer patients, anxiety, and more. Perhaps break this into studies of common drugs, how they work, & effects and separately, the mechanisms of addiction and treatment. However, I appreciated the 'reduce harm' policy economics.",1

36231,"Very interesting course that gives basic information on a lot of topics related to finance and financial markets. Highly recommend for people interested in the topic with none or very little knowledge about it. The professor is not the best public speaker (paces around, use a lot of ums, forgets his sentences and so on), but after the first few lections you get used to it and it is okay. But for one of the guest speakers, I think it was week 5, for me was very painful to hear him speak, so I ended up reading the transcript, not listening to his speach.",5
12783,"Very well organized, focused",5
12021,It is an excellent course with good resources. The only problem is that you need to know Java to pass this course. It should have better assignments to evaluate us.,4
7919,"I find this course very useful, even if you do not have kids, like me. I would like to study more courses of nutrition after having taken this one. Thank you!",5
39387,Great course with lots of value addition,5
53380,"Great course, I've learnt a lot from Prof. Andrew Ng. Professor explained well on several complicated concepts that I used to be confused about, and he has carefully chosen the material to make it easily understood.I am really grateful that such course is provided for free, and I shall buy this course as my appreciation for such a wonderful platform.",5
5091,Highly recomended!!!!,5

77201,Course is pitched at a very elementary level--which I liked a lot. Assignments are doable and helpful. Instructor is simply amazing!,5
89391,"This course is very dense. The videos are short and to the point, making it a great overall review of the material, or very easy to review the challenging portions if it's your first time being introduced to it.The explanations are very clear, and assume no previous knowledge or subject-specific vocabulary. The illustrations help a great deal with my ability to stay focused, and the digestibility of the content.",5
13321,"A very informative course, looks at the application of game theory to the world of business. Clear explanations and good tests.I would like to know why he has an AT-AT next to him in lectures however.",4

104464,"Great course, also very good example for interdisciplinary communication to solve some of the riddleswe call existence/life",5
81789,"The course was great and I will be happy to continue with the next one from the stack. There was only one thing, which I would improve - the JavaScript lessons. They were not well explained at all and quite often I felt lost in the videos. I needed to know why the code was written like that, why was there a dot and a space, etc, not see it already written and just go with it.",4
65657,Probably my favourite course.,5
103069,"Very practical, thorough and well presented. The presenter's self confidence comes through and adds great credibility to the course. Very easy to comprehend and listen too.",5

54857,Great course!,5
95326,This course was a good introduction to using Python for data science. I found the coverage of Pandas to be especially beneficial.,5
73566,Topics about Supply & Demand were interesting.Rest was too much theoretical for me. I would have liked shorter presentations with more concrete examples.Design of the presentations could be improved as well.,3
90710,"[I am speaking from my personal experience about this course. I don't mean to insult anyone or criticize the method of teaching and I am not doubting the credentials of instructors. It is just what I experienced from this course that I am saying. However, I don't mean to discourage anyone from attempting this course. This review is just a summary of what I felt about the first two weeks of this course.]I don't think this course is for the beginners at all. The teaching method did not quite please me. It appears that the instructors and TAs are simply reading the transcripts and bombarding equations on the screen. Also, the course hasn't made any reading material available, and they are not even providing the slides for the lectures (as of till DEC 2016).I have enrolled and completed a course on mobile robotics from Georgia Tech on Coursera and they were using slides and at the same time the instructors were scribbling equations on the slides and ensuring that they maintain synchronicity with the learning and showing them how a particular equation emerges. They also had lectures which were designed to help learners attempt the quiz and special section about MATLAB and how to build robots. They also provided slides to revise what was mentioned in the lectures. They were teaching and not reading from teleprompter.This course looked lot of theoretical and I am not sure for whom it is designed for. Also, in the discussion forum, I haven't received answer to the questions that I'm posting(since right now it's holiday season, I can exempt them from not replying).I knew I could carry on with this irritation and still get the course certificate for which I've paid for, but then there is no point in wasting time in which the explanation is not clear. It would take me almost 20 to 30 minutes to make notes over a 5 minute long video. I would rather read a book on this subject.I would have appreciated if they followed certain steps:1) Make some course material which will help students read and revise information.2) Suggest some reading/reference material to understand the concepts which are not otherwise covered in this course.3) Use pointers(touch screen devices) to show and point out which equations are being referred to and maintain synchronicity between the information given in the slides and the one said by the instructor.4) Supplementary lectures are extremely fast paced and please don't take derivation of an equation for granted and please do explain.So, if you are looking forward to do this course, I suggest you go forward if you have an in-depth knowledge about vectors, matrices and calculus.",1
70061,"This really is a terrific course (but then, what else would you expect from Georgia Tech?) The content is well designed, Professor Egerstedt is clearly extremely knowledgeable and also a great communicator, and the support team have been very active and helpful on the forums.I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in robotics.",5

69599,Awesome Instructor and course. It was the best Chinese course for Beginners.,5
69130,"I really liked the case study approach to the topic. The instructors' approach to teaching through the Python notebook made it easy to follow and see things implemented as you learned them. In addition, they presented the material at a good level - not too general not too detailed for an intro taste to the topic. The professors were engaging lecturers as well and I found myself quickly going through each week's content to get to the the enjoyable assignments. I'm excited for the other courses in the Specialization.",5
33014,"Its a course to take, the learning material is easy to follow and understand",5
12654,Perfect overview on machine learning methods. The numerical example could be better. The Neural Network is also didn't cover that is very common now.,4
54246,thanks,5
5187,It was a great and nice course. I remembered a lot o things and I knew some key concepts and approaches to learn. Thank you.,5
105473,I thoroughly enjoyed the course. Professor Centeno guided us through history to show that even wars can make some positive contributions to societies and to soldiers. You do not have to agree with him to notice that he is a very good online lecturer. It was my first MOOC where I felt I'm in an auditorium and not at my computer.,5

2245,Nice course and I am impressed,5
103977,"No stars for this course, 3 modules I did, and I think is not a valuable course, gives a bad introduction to the language, there are inconsistencies in the theory and knowledge of the language. The preparation of the course is poor, there is no direction, a lot of errors using playground and the instructors hesitate and doubt all the time during the recording of the screen. That's not good point for the prestigious University of Toronto and Coursera. One star for the review is too much, no preparation, lack of security, bad quality.",1
49973,Very helpful to get a logical perspective and to brush up on basics.,4
61280,A very nice course about leading organizations,5
40238,Prefer more references/examples shown in lectures.,3

90576,I love this course and the way the insights are presented. Thank you.,4
67154,"I have mixed feelings about this course. On one hand, scope is ambitious and getting to attend a course by G Hinton is a luxury. On the other hand, some topics are addressed confusingly (e.g. Hopfield Nets) or without going into much detail. But I think the worst of this course, and I wish Coursera would take care of that, is some quizzes being completely broken (missing or incorrect data), forcing you to go to Forums to get the correct question.There are big gaps of data and no course biography to follow or complete the missing gaps (lecture resources, when available, is just papers on the topic). Also, the course would benefit from better programming exercises... as it stands it is just ""download a program, complete a couple of methods, fill in the gaps on a quiz""",3
61295,"This course features a very structured approach into learning the basics of Chinese. Due to the fact that videos are used (that are downloadable with tape scripts and subtitles) you get a clear understanding of how things are pronounced. The teachers featured in this course speak very clear and not to fast. Following the videos there are clear overviews of the new words and sentences you see in the video, this helped me understand things better. The tests that are used during this course are good and fit the material that the test is about.The subjects that you discuss during this course are all very relevant and useful in case you ever need the basic communication (for example hobbies, weather, etc..)Overall this course is very good and i would defiantly recommend it if you want to understand the basics of Chinese.",5

12257,"A good introduction to Workplace Communication.The resources supplied were extremely helpful.I didn't pay so much attention to the slides that came with this - in fact, I'm not even sure how relevant they are looking back.I had expected the overview videos to be an insight to the resource content, but it wasn't quite compiled that way.The tests could have been longer, and perhaps could have contained obvious solutions - in some instances the solutions provided were all applicable, leaving the student to select the best option. In other instances the options available weren't even discussed in the content, confusing the student.",3
28984,"Very good content, oo long, too many words to get to the point, and too many instructions on assignments.",3

76524,I extremely enjoyed this course. Its very well explained and although I'm in the field of CS. I feel anyone who is new to coding can learn from this course.,5
62776,Generally quite good in reviewing a multitude of aspects. I did miss not having my responses evaluated even though I decided just to audit this course. On almost all occassions others courses let you evaluate your learning as you go so this was disappointing.I did purchase Bloom's book which I find easy to read and very complimentary to the course.,4

69081,"The case study approach is a great idea.But I wish the instructors were more candid about the tools that were in use. It seems dodgy that the instructor is a CEO of a commercial tool vendor and is ""encouraging"" students to use it.The quizzes in the course were extremely shallow.",2

I wish to thank Dr Egger and Dr Schaich Borg for their energy, enthusiasm and time to make this course so good - and to making it accessible at such a reasonable cost to us in Africa. The dancing videos were a scream and I finally ""get"" the unicorn thing. One of the most profound learning experiences I've ever had.",5

79109,"Although I really liked this course (not having paid for it, just watching the videos and the discussions), I think you guys make way too much emphasis on child psychology. Not that this is a bad thing, I actually loved the way you approached the problem of how popularity and its conceptions changes over age, I think you could add some other examples of popularity in adulthood.

Yonsei utilizes this important element for long term memory consolidation. I learned a great deal. I now understand the finer points of grammar, such as particle usage, counters, and how to properly construct grammatically correct sentences. This course has given me a solid foundation in which to build upon. I wish that Yonsei University would offer an intermediate course :) Thank you so much!!",5
96661,it's really a deep look into the bootstrap frameworkIt's excellent to the newbies of bootstrap to cahge them from zeros to heros but for a man like me that have been working for 3 years with bootstrap it was tedious but had to take it to complete the speclization,5

I had some informal training at the pharmaceutical company in clinical data management, but this went over nitty gritty of the process and area of data management. Although it did not use the typical Oracle Clinical or related software, it did introduce us to REDcap. Just be aware that this is not a course that will teach you the job of a clinical data manager and show you how to use all the software, it is a course that introduces you to the topic of data management and REDcap. I still highly recommend it.",5
42669,Very intersting and challenging. Will try to use all the techniques ;),5
69646,This is an excellent course if you want to learn the basics of Chinese.,5
89458,"Good Course. It should be complemented with reading of Neuman, Quantitative and Qualitative Methods in Social Science, which gives a far better overview of the contents of week 1 and 2 (insights into the scientific method). Nevertheless the rest of the weeks are very good and should provide a great framework of Quantitative methods for a undergraduate student, who can then complement this framework with some detailed additional readings, if it is of his liking. All in all, I really ended my fisrt college semester with an excellent knowledge in quantitative methods, for which I have to thank, in part to Miss Scholten for this wonderful course.",4
75449,This was one of the best courses I have ever had the pleasure to study. Professor Charles Severance is a phenomenal and exceptional instructor with super human teaching capabilities. Every basic aspect of Python is very brilliantly covered in the course.,5
17423,"The course, The Craft of Setting and Description, allows students to delve into the skills needed for polished creative writing. Amity Gaige was a great instructor who provided exercises and lectures that stretched my imagination. I really enjoyed this course.",4

64942,"I was actually very excited for this course, yet it disappointed me. The lectures were monotonous and stiff, I found myself watching the videos on mute with the subtitles on! (p.s. the persons who transcribed the videos should have taken the time to see and hear what they were translating since there are quite a few errors on names, locations, even simple words). I also found the lessons rather superficial, did not ""dive"" into the heart of this great civilization. Finally, having read a book or two on the subject, the whole experience added almost nothing to my previous knowledge on ancient Egypt. The course is good for those who have no previous knowledge on the subject and wish to learn the basics regarding Egypt, its gods, mummies etc.",2

71069,"Fantastic course, well-structured and -presented! I liked the presentation style, a combination of prepared slides, live hand-written annotations and live code examples.

102263,"An evaluation is always tied to the value it provides in relation to the paid price.On the plus side:1) It provides an interesting historical perspective of Search Engines, their evolution and the evolution of the algorithms and their purposes.2) Rebeka May talks slowly and clearly. The transcripts also help in reviewing the contents of each lesson.On the minus side:1) It is very theoretical and with no practical application.2) Lots of terminology pops out of the blue without any prior explanation, and would be difficult to understand for a total newbie. Just as a very simple example, backlinks are mentioned several times. What is a "" backlink"" ?? I know what they are, but not everybody does.3) There should be real support material, not merely "" transcripts""4) The Peer review does not make any sense. There should be a real test. The peers do not have a ""higher"" knowledge level to make an evaluation of the alummni.5) It is not possible to take the quizzes unless you "" upgrade"" . Presently this costs $ 80.Conclusion: it is an interesting course, but at $ 80 provides no value.Audit the course instead. UC Davies and Coursera should provide this course free of charge or with a voluntary ""donation""",2

15973,The quality of videos was pretty poor. The question and answer format of discussion was not a great idea (might have been great for kids videos). Doesn't enthuse us to continue the course.

90517,"The course was good. I enjoyed it. The biggest problem was the un-moderated participation of at least one other student. This particular student drove the discussion of assignments, leaving little room for others to explore, ask, and answer questions. As far as I know the student was not a mentor/TA, but It would have been most helpful for staff to weigh in on some of the student's post. I really believe the student was feeding his/her ego.",3

69069,"Excellent case study approach. Hopefully, other methods-rather than graphlab- will be included as well in future courses.",4
89077,The course content is very superficial. The pass mark is very high for a course I had taken because of a mild interest. You have to get 80% to pass. One unit in particular was very confusing. It took me 7 attempts to pass it as I had no idea what the first question was about and there was no guidance as to what I was doing wrong.,3

94129,"This course saved me. I started my business but nobody knew I existed. For entrepreneurs, it doesn't matter how good you are in your field. You need to be able to sell your services or product to customers. New clients will not come to you. You have to go to them. And that's how this course saved me. It guides you through the selling process right from defining your market through to closing the sale. Before the course, I had no concept of this process. Now I feel confident executing the sales process and getting my first clients through a SALE rather than word-of-mouth. A highly recommended time investment for entrepreneurs.

42088,"Professor Lipschitz is an amazing lecturer. As a professional archeologist who focused on US prehistoric societies during my graduate studies, I find this class fascinating. The ability to tie archeology to history through written documents is an approach that works quite well. Professor Lipschitzâ€™ use of maps in the lectures really helps to follow the battles and takeovers throughout the Fertile Crescent. I also have to recognize the excellent lecture that Professor Cohen presented on the Babylonian Chronicles. I hope at some point, Professor Cohen is able to present a full class on Assyriology. I will also sign up for any additional courses taught by Professor Lipschitz.",5

104504,"I really enjoyed this course. An interesting mix of history, philosophy and psychology. I enjoyed the written assignments as it made me think harder about the course material than just passing the quizzes. Reviewing others' work was fascinating too, as it made me consider things from different points of view (though I do think the reviewing criteria would've benefitted from being just a little bit more detailed, to better reflect the huge variation in standard between submissions).I'm very much looking forward to the next module!",5

I recoomend to remove this topic and focus more on solidifying foundations so that students can be more prepared for moving through the whole Algorithm Courses.

106426,"This is a great course! Lots to think about. It turns out Transmedia Storytelling is a lot harder than you might think. It's not just branding across different channels. The course is clear, builds on itself from week to week, challenges you to think and write and then apply your new understanding as you grade your peers.

8451,"The course provided almost no value , and there was almost nothing covered that you couldn't find online for free. The presentation was probably the worst part of the course: It was extremely boring and made it hard to get through the videos.I didn't expect much practical parts in the course, but there was even less than what I expected: What was described as setting up a hadoop cluster consisted of downloading a preconfigured VM image and running it, and then typing in a couple of commands that were provided to you. Again, nothing of value was added, and quickly going over the FAQ page of any of the products mentioned would be more helpful, faster and a lot more interesting.",1

19096,"The course topic itself and the syllabus was interesting and magnetic especially for someone like me who is equally interested in Economics, Game Theory, Mathematics and Computer Science. But I do feel that the concepts can be dealt with more theoretically so as to build formal background. I know it is difficult to make it mathematically heavy but still some of the concepts should have a theoretical explanation and proofs.Overall, course was good and I learnt a lot of new things.",4
68038,"In general it is a good introductory course. The lectures are easy to understand and the learning materials, especially the notebooks, are very useful, but it is a pity to know that the last two courses of the specialization were closed.

12417,a wide spectrum of tools practiced. awesome!,5
25403,"This course as much content in it and it's difficult to have an holistic idea how it all fits together. Some videos are taught having the same problem like, for example, some tools/themes are presented without us knowing what they are for. E.g., Chi-squared test and null hypothesis. Only after a while we understand their use. This bring a lot of overhead to us who are learning.Some videos seem to have been re-worked over time and present cuts or jumps.As for assignments, they should be better worked because some questions are not clear or misleading regarding the criteria that you want to evaluate.For example, I already reported that in Question 2. and 3. of the assignment for the 3rd week. The example you give is a short introduction with two problems: 1) ""I did the website"", which can make the participant not to be at ease to criticize and 2) we're no evaluating the participant performance but the website. Next, you ask us to rewrite the introduction, which we do with those two problems in mind. Now, when we do the peer review we realize that you're expecting for us to rate the new introduction based on having ""early prototype"" and ""user feedback"". The original problems just seem not to count. Only by chance you can eventually write the new introduction touching the points that count for grading.",3

94317,"The lectures were great and engaging. I felt like they went too fast. Jeff says at the beginning that this is just an overview and points to some other resources. As an overview, this class works well. You can expect to learn a bit about what machine learning is and how to to do it using the caret package in R.",4
45601,Really well taught!,5
5630,"the instructor is really harsh, don't piss him off!",5
98329,"No option of completing the course without paying. So why do you call your site FREE online courses? And why do we have to go into the trouble of attending the class and watching the videos, and reading the material without being capable of at least watching our results in assignments?",1
72176,I really enjoyed taking this course. It provided many elements and tools to help new teachers create and implement new strategies for their students and their classrooms.,5
87051,The best course for getting started with Python and thinking about computer programming.,5
85316,"so far, informative class with sort of funny lecture (examples that is)...",5
54101,"Excellent level for presenting the theory. I would have spent a bit more time on the ""homeworks"" because it was quite hard to understand it. I had to use the forums, otherwise I wouldn't make it.",4

98178,Good course,4
35337,very helpful,5
37389,Fill in the blanks others courses I did about HTML. This one is complete and more uo-to-date and I have perceived it as directed to real corporate applications rather than to layouts that do not follow what the corporate market needs. The instructor is excellent as being simple and clear to a subject that must be approached in this way to keep you going on fast.,5

35399,"It was very enlightening; it made me realize the complexities and evolution of diplomacy while understanding what it takes to become a good diplomat in general. Specifically, I got new insights on how I can impact positively within the realm of nature conservation from a global perspective and how to tackle the threats we are facing in the near future. I would have liked though a bit more interaction with the experts and opinions from them on my/our submissions.",4
2738,What a wonderful course. It gives each of us a way to help in the best possible manner. One would think that only serious philanthropists can help when in fact every single person can.,5
51827,"Awesome, I only need just one word ""awesome"" to express what I think of this course. With ease, I've learned about all the historical approaches of language learning; although, I've read these approaches before, but I never understood them so well until now. many thanks to ASU and Shane Dixon.",5
67530,This specific course traded off depth and detail for breadth of topics. Too many ideas were quickly described and not really built up to my liking.,3
100949,that is good course,4
17444,"Very thought provoking, inspiring and educational.",5
13965,Excellent overview of information.,5

18769,"The Probability section could use more practical examples, I found it difficult to follow.",3
8711,This course is excellent and very interesting!,5
68804,"A fascinating tour of what's possible today with modern machine learning tools. The beauty and challenge of this course is the approach - diving right in to the tools to work through and experiment with some case studies. This is not a talk and visuals only course. You will be hands on.This may be demanding for some, but is worth the effort. The course says no previous experience necessary in Python, but I recommend having at least completed a beginner's course before trying to tackle this. (Or familiarized yourself with Python if you have other programming experience - it has its quirks, like every language.)The course will introduce you to the current state of play in machine learning and both show you what's possible and also where the limitations are. This is not a superficial course (talking points only) - you will learn enough to be dangerous. If you want to be a little safer, do the follow-on courses too. (At this time, only the 2nd course has run - regression - but it was very good).",5
72953,Starting the course I wasn't that into typography. The seminar gave me an other more interesting and creative point of view on that field.,5
15434,I love the course ... its Awesome ... Thanks Coursera,5
43811,It was an eye opener for me!,5
90177,"Although the course covers interesting subject areas, I feel like the various topics should have been explored to a greater depth. I understand that someone with lesser background in the relevant areas might not agree with me. But overall, I felt slightly underwhelmed by the course.Also, the skeleton of code provided for the assignments had minor errors and the instructions for assignments were sometimes ambiguous or even incorrect as compared to what was actually required of the code. But these minor issues will most likely get resolved in subsequent offerings of the course.",3
23606,"This was my first course, and I hope all future courses are exactly like this one! Maya has such a nice way of talking. The videos were easy to understand, without compromising substance. I also enjoyed the overall high-quality of the course. My only complaint is that some of the topics seemed a little bit irrelevant, such as the case study of a middle-aged, pre-diabetic man. I feel like that video should've been shortened by sevety-five percent and tacked onto the end of another video as an example.",4
41469,"As usual the 4 professors(presenters) have done an excellent job. The resources, videos, assignments and quizzes are very helpful, well thought out and comprehensive. They have done an enormous amount of work.But there seem to be problems with the import edu.duke.* due to installation problems (e.g. Windows 10).Maybe include 3 videos like:( example from other Coursera courses e.g. R Programming)Installing BlueJ on a MacInstalling BlueJ on WindowsInstalling Bluej on (Mac) ; including these would enable me to give a rating of 5 stars.For the beginner programmer this would help a lot.I know there is the Discussions forum (very helpful) and students must sweat a bit to get BlueJ to work on some messy Operating Systems but this is my comment as a Beta Tester",4
80873,"I thought the instructor was very well organized, and knowledgeable. However, the information I received, at times, appeared more descriptive than informative. What I mean, is that I feel that we were told a lot about how things are, and very little about what to do. Overall, great instructor, I had expected more ""strategy"" and ""guidance.""",2
92296,Another excellent course ... Congratulations to the University of Michigan and Dr. Chuck.,5

Overall, a great course.",5
90516,Week1 and Week2 should be swapped I guess.,4
77062,A thorough introductory of Python!,5

13147,Great course.,5
31956,"This is a great introduction to Israel and Middle Eastern politics. It's not too tough- everything is broken down into very manageable 7 or 8 minute lessons, so it's easy to acquire a general understanding of the factors that led to the formation of Israel. Students looking for an in-depth examination may be disappointed, but if you're curious about this fascinating and very relevant chapter of history, this course will give you a good overview, and leave you hungry to learn more.",4

16842,"Having no experience in cyber security, this course is helping me understand the basics of cyber security so that I may advance in Cyber forensics. I highly recommend it.",4
36399,"Terrible course: (i) the lecturer seems to be ""all over the place"", briefly touching on several aspects of finance in a superficial way, without much coherence with respect to each week's theme; (ii) the lecturer speaks in a very confusing way, without formulating clear sentences and often divagating from the main topic with minor details that are neither necessarily relevant, nor properly explained; (iii) the few formulas that the lecturer presents are treated as if they have fallen from the sky en bloc, without explaining bit by bit how they are obtained; (iv) the main points of each lecture are not stressed sufficiently enough, leaving one to wonder what the take-home messages are at the end of each lecture.I give the course one star due to the appreciated emphasis that the lecturer places on unorthodox economic approaches, such as behavioural economics, and on the important issue of finance democratisation.",1
3023,"Very fun with an amazing teacher ! In that conditions, Mathematics are pure pleasure. Take it and enjoy.",5
102752,"I'm really enjoying this course, and especially like the written midterm and final (which we haven't submitted yet) and the peer review system which allows us to read other students' thoughts on the course material as well.

The way things get related and start making sense helped me get to another level in my knowledge of history. I will never study any subject without making reference to other important events that happened elsewhere. And will always refer my readings on this theme to what I learned in this course. Great chance to watch Professor Zelikow's classes from Brazil. Thanks Coursera!",5
3391,Great course.,5
54918,Perhaps the best thing to have happened to me!,5
97874,"This course is great to get to grips with the design thinking methodology and tools. Down side is that you only get feedback on your work from your peers, not from faculty.",4

74754,"Prof. Charles Severance is one of the most awesome professors I've learnt from. He teaches extremely well, adds a Dr. Chuck touch to it with his impeccable sense of humor, and gets his message through to us students. (AND.. I absolutely love Snape; may Alan Rickman's soul rest in peace).I am looking forward to the next part of Programming for Everybody (with Data Structures in Python). The thing I appreciate most about this course is that it is completely open to all, from the quizzes and grading to all the course material. This way, people like me can learn happily learn such in-demand subjects & programming languages, without having to worry about paying a fee. I would like to extend a sincere thanks to you all for the same.",5

35974,"This course helped me, an engineer, to get an insight into the financial world especially into the investment management.",5
91355,"As an advanced English speaker, for me this course goes too little into improvement of pronounciation.The tips for conversations - small talk, phone, online etc. - are only very basic as well.Good course for beginners though and I also liked the interspersal of little questions and tasks along the way (although also too simple imo).Very good - but obviously only paid content - are the teamwork assignments.",4
6072,Very good for everyone who want to know about Big Questions.,5
79820,Questions should be a bit more difficult.,4
7906,i like this course very much....and this is my 1st course....,4
90374,Maybe it would be better to add more exercises to assimilate better the content. Same as previous courses in the Specialization.,4

85903,Great skills to learn!,4
31090,"This is an excellent refresher course to brush up on grammar and punctuation. Prior to taking this course, I was an overzealous user of commas. Now, I know when to use certain punctuation and how to explain it to others. I definitely recommend this course for anyone wanting to revise English grammar and punctuation for the purpose of teaching or tutoring.",5
64167,"Professor Asher Susser is a very good speaker, and the course is very well organized. The subjects he discuss are very interesting; I enjoyed listening to him for hours.

43156,it's a great course that will help you save time and effort and study smart,4
101564,"You will learn nothing from this. The teacher is useless and you only get peer-feedback. While I usually love peer feedback, I lost all interest so quickly.",1
38695,"i gave this course 1 star not because its bad in content, its just because i was expecting more due to the fact it has been delayed several times; then when it finally came it was like any other youtube or online tutorial. i was expecting something as big as udacity but unfortunately its not. Don't expect to know or understand java with this course, no practical or step by step example in this course. what makes it worst is the fact they never show you how to build an app from scratch while the only app they have in this course, they dont do it. you have to do it on your own.dont get me wrong. all of them are good instructors but the way they did it, its definitely is not a beginner friendly. give a calculator as an assignment to build while you never built one app in this course, i think its not an effective way to teach. i will not pay for this specialization. i will do the udacity nanodegree one",1
73596,"This course amazingly uses all modern communication facilities to create intellectual and other ties between tens of thousands of people all over the globe, succeeding at making it a very personal course in which every single person is invited to take part. All is made possible by the never ending work and creation done by Prof Al Filreis and the loving intelligent ever giving people in his team.Each course participant may get deeply involved in the discussions, and threads, and write essays, and read peer essays, and call in, and write mails, or, as I chose to do, stand by and watch and read and listen without getting personally involved.This course has surely changed many people's lives!!!",5

102741,"I really enjoyed this course which was novel to combine some of the essential Buddhist teaching with what modern psychology could support and interpret. I would say, even if you studied psychology and read some Buddhist writers, that Dr. Wright delivers a professional and engaging course that will give one food for thought as well as making clear some esoteric Buddhist concepts one may struggle with. It's refreshing to find similarities between what science and the Buddha postulate regarding the self, attachment and that the assigning of form/feelings to our environment may cause unhappiness/dissatisfaction. Great course and well presented!",5

15334,"I appreciate the fact that this course doesn't go into the fine detail on how to code everything, I believe there is still more information on the coding and data management practices that could be included in the course content. In addition to that, I feel the course could use the following adjustments to make it better:1 - Have Python students grade other Python students and SAS students grade other SAS students. While it is nice to get exposure to another language, it is more than enough to learn one at a time.2 - Add quizes and/or other well formed questions that are graded (automatically, not peer graded) to help enforce the concepts being taught.3 - Make the assignment instructions/expectations more clear. I feel there are times when the grading criteria don't exactly match the requested assignment. While people follow the spirit of the assignment, the grading questions may ask for slightly different or additional items.4 - Certain aspects of statistical analysis are glossed over and should be covered in more depth in the training videos. While I like the short videos for brevity, I would prefer to watch 10-15 minutes more content and really feel like the material was well covered.",3

5944,"I always wanted to improve the algorithms and data structures field. The books wasn't so efficient. Especially they weren't so practical. These courses are the first courses where I really got a lot of knowledge. Especially because of assignments. All lectors are very good in explanation of the material and tell many additional useful things. These courses are the really good base, after which you can open the books related to algorithms and read more details if you needed.I am definitely going to complete the whole specialization!The only thing which was not convenient for me is that both courses Algorithmic Toolbox and Data Structures are started at the same time. It was difficult to find out the time for both courses and spend enough time to solve all assignments instead of only enough for passing.Anyway, now I am started the second iteration of the course and I am going to solve all assignments which I skipped.Big thanks to Daniel, Alex, Pavel, Neil and Mike!Regards,Sergey",5

3316,"This course is deceivingly full of content. If you want to get through this course you need to have a lot of time on your hands because of the shear amount of debugs your code will produce even if you follow the steps to the letter. So many things are taught over a 4 week period that if you do not do the extra reading to understand what is happening you will get an overview of angularjs, bower, gulp, grunt, yo, yeoman and so on without really knowing how to use any of these tools again. Also because of the number of interdependent parts to the application you create, when the professor decides to give you one of the html or js files again to do an assignment, chances are everything will break and you will spend a long time figuring out which variables' names have been changed and blabla...The professor does not give you a good basis for debugging your code, you need to modify the set up of gulp to show understandable stack traces to figure out what is going wrong.If you want a challenging course where you have to go the extra mile learning things from documentation and blogs to substitute the lack of detail in order to complete the course, than this is the course for you!I think this course needs to be restructured and the length increased to 6 weeks instead of 4, with more detailed content and understand of each tool and especially more on angularjs",3

83030,"This course is really amazing. The lecture is well-organised and lecture material is good. This course covers basic knowledge about representation in Probabilistic Graphical Model. It includes Markov Network, Bayesian Network, Template Model and some other knowledge. The assignments, oh, I have to say, although some quiz in it seems like having bug, are still impressive. I strongly recommend finishing all the programming assignments of this course. Some trick parts of the knowledge taught in the course are covered by the assignments (like template model part, trust me you have to think about the template model part really, really carefully to figure out what it exactly means). Anyway, it worth my payment :-).If you wanna take this course, buying a textbook is a good choice because there are some extra knowledge which is not covered by this course in the textbook. However, without a textbook you can still continue. I really appreciate Professor Koller for offering such a great, amazing course!",5

Course tries to maintain simplicity and clarity of explanations even for very complex things and this is exactly what you need for a subject which is normally deemed too complex for beginners or gives an explanations which for uninitiated do not add clarity and rather raise even more questions.Loads of fun and topics which may make you think more and induce your curiosity.",5

95774,"Unfortunately I found this course to be the least enjoyable so far in the specialization. I'm not sure if I was just jarred by the change in instructor, but I found her manner of lecture to be almost belittling. I'm not sure if she's a mother or not, but that's the way she comes across--like she's trying to squeeze massive and advanced theory into a pill designed for ten year-olds.A majority of this class simply glossed over things we already learned in the intro class, and she would often list things she was going to talk about, and then ignore one of those items entirely. In fact, one of the most challenging assignments in this course was building a journey map, something that was mentioned in the lectures, but not gone into in depth at all. I tackled this challenge by sort of haphazardly googling journey maps and praying my submission would come across as somewhat logical.Ultimately I'm very disappointed with this part of the specialization. I don't feel like it was worth my $39, and would love to see this class completely redesigned for future learners. Research and prototyping is arguably one of the most important things for a burgeoning UX designer to learn, and this class could stand to be a lot more in depth.",2
103574,Thank you very much for producing the excellent course. It was extremely clear and informative and delivered in a very engaging and stimulating manner.,5

19810,"Although this course holds quite a lot of information, it is quite slow in the way the information is transmitted and unfortunately, the presenter did not 'made homework' in terms of preparing what to say. In addition to the lagging of 'so, anyways, uhmm...' or just silence, many of the videos are also quite low in quality - especially sound due to bad microphone.Overall the information was interesting and useful, and I'm looking for Part II.",2

16240,"This is definitely one of the best MOOCs on Sociology I have ever taken, and I am new to online learning so you can imagine! The professor is funny, clear and passionate about his work, his lectures and his students!! I couldn't believe this MOOC was over so quickly as I couldn't stop reading and watching more videos. I'm looking forward to more on this topic from Professor Heerikhuizen and the UvA on Modern Sociological Theory. I hope this MOOC will become a MicroMaster Program and I even might get my Master's degree in the future on Sociology (when time and finances permit). I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about our society, dealing with people, situations etc. By having a more sociological mindset, it will allow us to be less judgmental, communicate more effectively and see the world as a whole instead of bits and pieces. Then again, in order to understand the world, one must start with the individual. Very interesting!!!",5
98552,"I am a strictly Quantitative Scientist so I was not sure if I would like this course or enjoy it. Surprisingly, I both liked it and enjoyed it. It was interesting learning about the Qualitative Methods that I had no idea about. The professor is very animated and keeps your interest throughout the course.

Otherwise you will be faced with the painfully frustrating task of learning a package while trying to complete an assignment, all with a short deadline.",1
79639,"Absolutely superb. It's incredible how much ground is covered from start to finish, yet the design of the course, the languages and the computer itself are so elegantly conceived that the creators have achieved the seemingly impossible: to provide a deep understanding of every level of a modern computer system in 8 weeks.

Some of the quizes seems redundant, ie., ask very basic questions which can be answered with common sense w/o knowing the content, but all in all give good intro.I gained enough knowledge to challenge PhDs specializing in ML when we brainstorm stuff.",5
8241,Highly Knowledgeable & learning.,4
97060,"This course was very boring and very frustrating. Long long slow lectures with lots, and lots, and lots of questions, and no answers. The briefest of comments on potentially interesting people or topics, but no links to enable those to be followed up. Quizzes on concepts not covered in the material. Conflicting descriptions of assessment requirements. Discussion moderators who continually referred you back to the course material which did not contain the information that people were looking for. Before taking this course I could find only one negative review, which I dismissed as probably being a minority. Having taken the course, I agree with that review wholeheartedly. I did learn a couple of things, despite everything, but I would not recommend this course. Please upgrade it substantially.",1

I did enjoy the first course, America's Written Constitution but someone was paying attention then and it was on the older format so it was better. I rate the course so poorly, however, because of the total lack of staff involvement and the worthless peer review papers. I have a huge problem with the peer review process. It is of no value and should be banned. Be that as it may, however, it takes weeks to get reviews and there is NO ONE FROM THE COURSE STAFF PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO THE COURSE!! There is not one posting from course staff in the forums. There has been no response to any of the so called, ""comment on this assignment"" messages I've been leaving since JULY. There has been no response to an e-mail, supposedly sent to the instructor on my behalf by the Coursera help desk weeks ago. It is obvious that the instructor has abandoned this course. If no one is going to pay attention to it, it should be taken down. If you just want the information, watch the videos but don't expect anything else, including any response whatsoever from this course. I've wasted too much time on this. I'm done.",1

103853,"Having completed the assignment after many hours of trial & error; here are some suggestions for improving the class for future sessions.Increase the length and depth of the lectures so that more of the materials needed for the assignment are covered.For each week, have an optional programming exercise (not graded) but with a model answer (with explanations of why) so that students have a concrete example on which to practice key concepts on.As classes & structs are very important to completing the assignment (instead of just including the SWIFT manual chapter on classes & structs in the Follow Up Reading), include an actual lecture about this topic.Improve the description of the assignment to be completed. Be specific about what is required (e.g.; what does interface mean? Is is a User interface or is just a specified variable which can be changed in the program code? What do you mean by order of applying filters? Do you mean a variable which lets you decide order of filters and executes the filters accordingly or does the ability to manually rearranging the order of the calling of functions in the code suffice?)Improve the alignment between the assignment and the review criteria. The assignment asks for FIVE filters but there is no matching criterion in the review criteria. Based on the current review criteria, creating two filters would suffice to demonstrate ability to order and get full points for varying intensity for more than 1 filter.I hope the remainder of the modules are better otherwise I will be extremely disappointed !",2

29498,"Duke.... Coursera... guys, come on! I'd like to contrast this with the Wharton Business Analytics specialization that I'm completing. It was like night and day. I mean, professors in that course are presenting their own research! Cade Massey presents research he did with Dick Thaler! None of that happens here. The information shared doesn't even flow smoothly.This course relies mainly on PDF slides (if I wanted to read, I would've bought a book). At one point, it even links to 6 articles on another website (and that's in the quiz as well). It seems like very little effort was put into this online class by the professors. The slides themselves seemed scatter-brained, several times asking questions that are never even answered. It was almost as if someone took already prepared slides from a course and just kind of mashed them with a very little bit of video to make an ""online"" course. Even the answers to quizzes seemed extremely vague (it often felt like there were several right answers... or none -- to me, this is sloppy quiz writing).I honestly expected better from both Coursera and Duke! The only redeeming part about this course is that behavioral economics is honestly compelling, despite the shortcomings pointed out.",1

That was a bit lost on me, mainly because i didn't really appreciate why i should want to (I can understand many reasons, but none felt very close at hand). I think it would have been more enjoyable with useful examples and practice.Ok, the course is still worth doing, but i think there is much room for creating a smooth and enjoyable learning process.

If you have no previous R experience, like me, but you can hold your own at programming,(me again) you can pass the course.

95057,"Thanks for the course. A few things that can be improved:1- The video material was very short. I expected same amount of teaching like homework, but it's more like 30 minutes versus 7 hours every week. As a result it's mostly googling and copy-pasting code, which I'm very sceptical if solving issues this way will enter my long-term memory. Probably next time I will need to look it up again. I'd prefer if the videos were the source of knowledge instead of stack overflow and the forum.2 - As an experienced programmer but being new to Python I found it difficult to load the data. I was not aware that the files are available on the server and can just be loaded by read_csv(filename.csv). Instead I tried to load the files from my local drive, which worked, but not for the grader. Then I tried to submit it offline which also failed. I wasted half a day on this. I suggest to mention quickly how the online and offline assignments work, in particular in how to load data.3 - The feedback from the grader is usually not telling much. It was often unclear to me what was the expected outcome. I think a screenshot of the expected answer for the more advanced questions (first few rows+columns) would help a lot and save us a lot of suffering.",2

Thank you Aric Rindfleisch.I take the course for the need to learn a new profession such as the Digital Markiting in the World, which I wish to allow me to become a Web analyst, to be able to work in Marketing and receive a job that is remunerated in international currencies that facilitate improvement The family income and at the same time to perform in a career that has much to do with my work as Professor in Management especially in Industrial Psychology in the areas of Innovation and transformation given that they study the behavior that in the case of the course is the consumer their behaviors , Opinions and shopping.In that respect I believe I am in what I have performed all my life,Thanks to the special promoters Aric AND TO ALL THE TEAM THAT ARE AN EXCELLENT TEACHERS and to be Human for their humility and desire to teach the good.THANK YOU",5

46351,"This is an extremely useful course. I recommend it for everyone, no matter your level of education or indeed your age. I think this course should be mandatory for both high school students and their parents. The main reason being so that students can master these skills early in their years and both parents and students understand, in particular, the value of exercise and sleep in learning. Thank you to all those people who put together this course. Although Dr Oakley and Dr Sejnowski are the faces of this course, I know there were many more involved in the conceptualisation and building of this course. Thank you for making it a MOOC and thank you for such a wonderful clear format that was easy to follow.",5
248,"Sorry to say but among the four courses of this specialization, this one really disappointed me. Not the fault of teachers or institute, i think the only mistake they made is try to fit too many topics in one course. Anyway this is only my opinion!",3

92964,"Good intention but the programming assignments were much much harder than what was covered in the mostly theoretical lectures and the more practical but not as advanced swirl exercises. After reading other reviews of this course, and struggling to complete the FIRST programming assignment, I canceled. Please do not advertise this as for beginners - I think people who have had some programming experience before would find this great, but not for the newbie.",2
69287,This is excellent. Thanks to coursera!,5

40948,"I was surprised at how difficult at first people made their simple games for the first few weeks. It was cool to see some really creative games that inspired and helped me with my ideas as well. The teaching videos were great and immersive that I laughed out loud at sometimes. Like ""don't touch that there's a bomb"" and then just touching the bomb and the puppet exploding. (2 ways to explain something in a game)I loved the course and look forward to the second course! Thank you CALARTS!!!!",5
82020,"The course covered quite a decent amount of content, but personally I think it was a bit fast for a beginner.",4
68246,"Very cool course. I can say is the best course for intro to a big science called machine learning, have a lot of good real life examples, with gread mathematical understaing of how things works, i thinks is really cool course",5
85802,This was a difficult course for me. I don't have a background in a field that required me to have been involved in projects of the scope that was commonly discussed. I will definitely be reviewing what I learned and look into the resources in more detail. I do think that many of the community service projects that I am often involved in will benefit from a bit more planning and team management. This will give me a solid foundation to work from.,4
91550,"Great course as the others in the specialization. As mentioned before, the emphasis on having the PMBOK Guide available for the optional readings should be emphasized.",5
72889,"I was only able to complete week 1 to week 3 thoroughly, and random check on other weeks due to limited time at my disposal at this moment.In general, I found the course to be very interesting and an excellent introduction to building predictive models . Particularly , i appreciate the way mathematical formulations was explained to carry along beginners in this areas.Nonetheless, I would suggest that the general notation slide in week 2 should include concrete data example in a table to explain the notations ie. x[j], xi[j], etc",5

20862,I like the course pattern as well as contain. It gives you all introductory information about Financial Markets. I am sure that I have enough knowledge to trade in market.,4
80191,I love this course. I love how I can slow down the video for the professor to speak slowly and she actually does so I can take notes. I also like how she provides you with a slide deck on the lecture so you can also go over that as well to learn (or re-learn) the information. Thank you!,5
73245,Great course!,5
38317,"Great course but for the amount of content provided and how much was taught this course is certainly overpriced...still a good introductory course, teaching very basic stuff.",3
7262,I recommend it,5
106792,"Very generic advice although the interviews with children's writers were illuminating and helpful. The marking system was inaccurate, for example it deducted marks for submitting an assignment over word count when it wasn't! Good, solid advice about setting character, scene and place and ideas to help you out of writer's block. The two main presenters were very knowledgeable and it was pitched to an international audience. Some of the activities were repetitious but I guess the craft of writing is but there was a sense of the course tapering away at the end with a proposal letter to a publisher with very little exemplar material being provided to assist.",2
64392,"Just one comment about how the course could be improved: the assignments should be more hands-on with fewer pieces of code written in advance. I say this is even though I am not a skilled programmer. The assignments would be a bit harder, but also a bit more rewarding.",4
15422,A great course that acted as an eye opener for me!! Thank you Duke University and thank you Coursera!,5
230,A very interesting course. Strengthening the advanced accounting concepts.,5
95390,Very good intro into how to use Pandas for working with data sets and get insights from your data by using various aggregating functions and statistical tests.,4
47419,"I'd not use the term the best course ever, but instead I must say that this course is one of the greatest and important courses in the Coursera platform.

4172,"Very good, recommended.",5
8320,Good introduction to general concepts. Does not require specific skills,4
78890,"Best statistics course I've ever taken. So many Aha! moments I can't count them.I have struggled for years to understand and get the hang of statistics, at uni, with online courses and at work. With this course (and the following courses) I think I have finally gained a DEEPER understanding of some of the basic but very important concepts of statistics. Lots of detailed examples and no overly complicated maths gibberish (although still mathematically sound!).The R programming bits run in parallel to the statistics lectures and can be followed (necessary for a certificate) or can be ignored (if you only want to grasp the concepts), but are overall very easy to understand and follow. There is only little background to R as a programming language and the different types of data, lists, matrices etc. To me that's a good thing, as it allows you to use R right away (which in turn makes me more motivated to go back and learn more about R).I whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone who wants to understand and use statistics!",5

51172,Incredible thanks to the teacher for this amazing course!!,5
69293,Like this course very much! Nice for begginers!,5
83051,"I found plenty of useful information in this course overall but lectures often spent too much time dwelling on the detail of simpler concepts while more complex areas, and sometimes critical information that was later built upon, were only touched briefly or sometimes skipped entirely. I missed a sense of continuity as we skipped from model to model with a minimum of time spent on how the models complement each other and their relative strengths and weaknesses in application.The way data structures were defined in the code was particularly difficult to deal with. The coding exercises all suffered as a result. It ended up taking way too much time to figure how to decode the data and trace logic around it. This meant that grasping concepts and learning from the questions came in a distant second priority to debugging.Dr Koller mentioned that the material is aimed at postgraduates. I felt that the level of content covered here would just as easily be grasped by most undergraduates in technical disciplines if it had been delivered in a more structured manner with clearer progression across models (conceptually and mathematically) and better code examples. When delivering in this format, allowances need to be made for the facts that tutorial sessions do not exist and the possibilities for informal Q&A are limited so any gaps become very difficult for students to fill in themselves.Despite the above shortcomings I'm glad I did the course and I would still recommend it to someone interested in graphical models as it does cover the basics well enough to make a decent start. I'm not sure whether or not I'd recommend the programming exercises as they are a significant time sink but at the same time, without spending time attacking the programming problems the concepts are not likely to gel based on the video and quizzes alone.",3

17299,Found the assignments were 'very loosely' aligned with the lecture material and had poorly formed problems in places.Lectures were reasonably good but not quite up to the standard set with other U of W Data Science courses or other University Data Science / Machine Learning courses I have taken.,3
73757,"I am really glad to take up this course, which helped me to understand the Python language. I am not a programmer before but found it not so hard to understand the concepts, so I would highly recommend starters to go through this course as the instructor teaches every topic interestingly in a fun way to learn and grasp things quickly.",5
102392,"Excellent course. Thoughtfully presented, by an instructor with considerable expertise in the field of evolutionary psychology who has also spent a lot of time thinking about religions and religious experience. Wright is ideally suited to navigate the content, and his interviews with other experts in the fields (and the fields are diverse) add greatly to the learning experience. Fantastic experience overall.",5
70503,very interesting and well thought out course.,5
76451,Nice course for the beginners.Go for It.,4
18396,"The programming environments used in this course probably won't be used in real life, they are used to get the very basics of programming.But I recommend it for absolute beginners with no knowledge of computer science whatsoever,someone who already knows at least one programming language already will probably be bored by the semantics, but what I really found useful was the step by step explanation on how how to solve programming problems, without using a block scheme or intuition.No teacher ever explained that in detail to me before.I heard they are cutting out the steganography project, or adding it as something optional, but that was actually very fun, hiding images in other images, as though I was a spy, sending off a message that would save that world...But,laughs aside,it felt like I was doing something practical.",4
99579,There were some useful examples in this course. But overall this course and the entire specialisation rely too heavily on Excel which seems a bit outdated when data sets are so much bigger these days (than the ones in this course). Based on the requirements of companies hiring data and business analysts the expectation for anybody who wants to work in this field is in at least one or more programming languages.,3

I plan on applying what I learned from this course at work.",5

After completing this course, and some personal work, one can hope to at least understand the language of jazz improvisation and become a far better listener, if not an improviser.",5
78997,"This course is definitly suitable for learners who don't have any related background. Dr. Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel has an amiable speaking style and always highlighted the key points in teaching videos, which helped me understand other contents in the textbook. Besides, the time and assignment arrangement of this course are also very reasonable. The only thing I could complain about is a system bug of the Amazon AWS and the grading system. My final project file went blank after the system told me the file uploading is sucessfully completed on August 3, and I got three 0 point from three peers since they only saw a blank file, of which I had no idea, and all I could see is ""Grading in progress"" on the system. Until the final grading day is over, which is August 12, the system finally reminded me of this horrible thing. I came to mentors, disscussion forum as well as the help center, reuploaded my file, desperately tried to find peers who can still spare some time to review my file, and it is finally fixed today.

72214,Can't recommend this enough. Professor Covach gives you everything you need as quickly as he can without making it drudgery at all. It made me delve deeper into The Beatles' music and especially into years of their music that I didn't fully appreciate before. Now I can't get Beatles songs out of my head on a daily basis and I have some extra insight that only enhances my appreciation of their incredible music even more.,5

16719,"Pros: The course content covers a lot of relevant topics on Database Management. Things like Basic SQL queries, Database Normalization, Conceptual and Logical databases, and making ER diagrams are covered in the course.Cons: Prof Mannino is a bit robotic in his reading out of long sentences and the constant pace of talking. There is tons of repetition of sentences and words mere seconds after they were just spoken. The lectures seem to be a collection of bullet points.The assignments and the peer review structure is really a low point. There's no specific grading rubric - so points allocation is random and based on your peer's assessment. I had many instances where my right answers were marked as wrong. There is nothing you can do to correct it. Moreover, the questions are iterative and thus the same apparent error carries on and you get multiple wrong scores.Assignments need to be submitted in documents. Separate documents for each question !! At times, even a one-line answer needs to be in a separate document. Pictures of database diagrams need to be pasted in said documents. It was a bit frustrating to take screenshots all the time. Especially when you make a small correction, and have to take screenshots AGAIN, then paste it AGAIN, and upload AGAIN !!Summary: Take the course for it's content, and use the assignments as good practice. Don't take the grading seriously. Also, focus on the content rather than the delivery by the professor, and you will still be able to get some value out of the course (and the specialization by extension)",3

90568,"Overall a good course for self-study. The assignments in particular are excellent for data cleaning, analysis and interpretation. The quizzes are very basic though and appear to be there only to check if the student has gone through the lectures. The knowledge needed to answer the quizzes and achieve the desired results in the assignments are vastly different and should be addressed.The case studies at the end are insightful and more use could be made of them in a more advanced course. There is a lot of repetition of concepts throughout the course and this can become distracting. THe format for the lecture videos varies throughout and this inconsistency (along with extreme audio volume changes) also becomes distracting.Other than that, excellent for driving the need for reproducible research (RR) home, presenting and explaining some tools available to achieve RR and ways of publishing results/reports from these studies.",3

32715,"This course tries to cover the many aspects around the games industry. But the coverage in each of the subject is not deep enough to be useful. For example, the instructor talks about project management, public speaking, how to write a resume etc. The instructor starts by talking about why they are useful, and then followed by one to two 10-15 minutes long video lectures. Each of these could worth a full Coursera course and I am sure the other courses have better coverage than in this course.The quiz questions are not well thought and do not stimulate thinking at all. Some of the ""correct"" answers are personal opinions but you have to choose them in order to pass the quiz.The third peer grading assessment asks students to post a video either to pitch himself/herself or to pitch the game the student makes. However, the specialization up to this point does not equip student with the skills beyond the basics. Unless you are already in the industry, I do not think anyone can make anything impressive to be worth pitching in front of the audience.",2

37804,"This is great course for beginners. All lessons built with a lot of practice, and thanks to David Rossiter everything clear and easy to understand. Thanks a lot Coursera team for this opportunity. You do a great job.",5
85485,"I did all four courses - the whole specialization. Each course in itself was aright and I learned new things. However, the course certificate is meaningless. It neither states the content nor the effort (for example the hours). Instead, it even says ""non-credit course"". This is despite the fact that the course equates ""35 PDU's"" and ""counts towards the UCI Project Management Certificate Programm""; as it was described in the FAQ. I feel betrayed. How can I apply with such a meaningless peace of paper anywhere?",1
11644,I am a C programmer with little knowledge of C++.This course really helped me to correlate both languages.,5

15324,"I'd pick 3.7 or so, really. The applied nature of the course is nice if you have a project in mind and to see the programming you learn in action. Without it, it might not be worth it because you could learn a lot of the SAS programming for free from SAS itself using their beginning programming coursework offered online (in fact potential students may consider taking the SAS programming essentials course before taking this because you learn a lot about the SAS coding framework that comes in handy for this class).",4
21831,"It is a very good course, but it does not follow the same level of proposed work as in the previous course (R Programming).",4
13647,"A very good course on Plot by Brandon Skyhorse. Would have loved to go in more details into scene construction and structure. That is why gave it 4 stars, else it was a clear cut 5 star",4

Also, the Instructor put a lot of emphasis on accessibility, which I think is really important.One thing a little bit frustrating, though, the codes in the quizzes look like mess when viewed on my phone and it really gave me a lot of trouble.

Of course, the level of the universities in my country is not nearly as that of the US; nevertheless, in the single combat ""Adv.Writing course against a ""Bachelor's degree"", the latter sustains a crushing defeat!",5
87883,Confusing. No help. Poorly presented.,1

15086,Great course! Explains the details of what is in the content of the rest of the certificate while not being too detailed. Showed which classes will be related to the content of each part of the introduction. Did a great job of setting up all required tools for the the R programming course (which I am currently taking).,5
91557,It's brief but it could help you for reviewing some concepts.,4
85439,The best of the courses in the specialization in my opinion.,5

65496,"An absolutely complete course that teaches about Luxury companies, but mainly about Fashion. There are 2 great teachers that gives contents, but also makes sudents think about future and trends. Cases and interviews are also great !! I got very impressed about quality of Albini Group. Its clearer for me definition luxury vs fashion, business models, differences, challenges and opportunities in Fashion companies. Thank you Bocconi !",5
46778,It's a great course.,5

77624,Fun way to learn about programming and Python!!!,5
79365,"Good course for beginners. I've picked up the nuances of branding via reading materials outside of this course, through my professional network, etc. and hence I was expecting more from the course.Also, I would like to mention that the quality of video lectures can significantly improve as some videos that were shot in an external location had too much noise and it was a distraction to focus on the lecture.",3

64208,"Really interesting course, as usual.",5
72630,The best,5
72705,"An excellent and quite extensive foray into regression analyses from single-variable linear regression to nearest-neighbor and kernel regression techniques, including how to use gradient vs. coordinate descent for optimization and proper L1 and L2 regularization methods. The lecture slides have some questionable pedagogical and aesthetic qualities, and they could use some more polish from someone who specializes in teaching presentation methods, but the meat of the course comes from its quizzes and programming assignments, which are well split between practical use (via Graphlab Create and SFrame) and a nuts-and-bolts assignment that have you implement these methods from scratch. An extremely valuable course for someone who wants to use these for a data science application but also wants to understand the mathematics and statistics behind them to an appreciable degree.",4
98026,"I really liked this course because it analyzes with balance the data, concepts and instruments of the great problems and challenges of global sustainability. The modular structure with videos, texts, readings, tests, collective tasks is clear, enjoyable and helps to study and re-study the contents. I have worked for several years as a consultant in corporate social responsibility and I manage a multimedia producer expert in the pedagogical design of courses and materials in environmental management. Through the course he learned a more precise reflection on sustainability issues and will soon start a postgraduate university course in Chile on Sustainability Management. This course helped me to make this decision.A final suggestion for the applications of this course is to update the information in the topics for appreciate better the trends . Thank you very much.",5

52060,Very useful information presented well by a knowledgeable professor who keeps you interested in the course. Thank you,5
51742,It was wonderful learning how approaches we use in class came about and knowing where the techniques we use in class originated,5
24929,Maybe som of the material i section 4 shoul have been given earlier?,4
39209,I love his accent,5
83182,"Good learning materials, however the assignments are designed for compute science students rather than professional software developers as the most important part of the assignments is not parallel code, but it is algorithms. Yes, there is parallel code in the code of the assignments, but it is mostly written and your task is to implement the algorithm using this existing parallel code, while in my opinion it should be the other way around - you should implement parallel code and algorithms code should be already provided for you.",3
26626,Excellent course! Very well structured and explained,5
64349,"Assignments were a little too easy, considering that students are expected to have taken the first two courses in the specialization. Otherwise, great course!",4
27102,Great course! Very well organized. Lots of useful information. Gives you a peek at real world application.,5
99223,"Positive: Very interesting and informative lectures and subject matter.Negative: Fellow ""students"" who have no knowledge of the subject (other than what they themselves are learning) are required to submit case studies for ""peer review"" by other students who have no more knowledge of the subject than they do. These case studies are heavily weighted and if the person is reviewed negatively (for whatever reason), they must resubmit it never knowing why they were given low scores or what the correct answer should have been. No instructor assistance is given. Huge turn-off for me and many of my fellow students. I want to withdraw (drop) this class and take another with more clearly drawn parameters.",1

77779,"Great introduction to Python! I enjoy learning from Chuck, some of his remarks definitely made me chuckle...haha. I'm very excited to learn more!",5
102512,"The course is extremely rich and sophisticated. I had taken it sometime back but after attending the 10 day Vipassana, I came back to take it again and it made much better sense. Prof. Wright is superlative in knowledge, neutrality of view, and of course humour. However one thing I'd recommend is that it becomes quite a challenge to follow the course after a while given (of course) the subject in hand as well as, importantly, the delivery style. I wish it had visual/ pictoral supplements or some other ideas implemented to make it penetrate better!",4
97794,"I enjoyed this course, it was challenging and well thought out. I am confident that I will be able to apply the concepts learned to my work. Kudos!",5
31470,Great course!,5

5053,Fantastic course. Best in the world,5
38810,"The course work was clear and well organized. Sometimes I did not understand the Edna, the teacher which is fine however sometimes the corresponding transcript indicated that what I heard was correct and that the words she said did not make sense grammatically. Nothing to get hung up on as I received the idea, which is the point.",4
17582,Great course guys! Thank you!,5
36430,Very inspiring and helpful class. I'm glad to have this class offered by coursera and given by Professor Shiller. Thank you.,5
61711,"Prof. Roth has covered a great many schools of philosophical thought...which, in turn, as driven me to look up more information out of curiosity. He takes an often-difficult course of study, and makes it not only easier, but makes it enjoyable.",4
68964,Love the practical application and the high level over view of the varius machine learning techniques. I would say this is an excellent course for introduction to Machine Learning.,5
9708,"This course is amazing! I used it to study Calculus, all the videos are self-explanatory and the excersizes are a fun way of checking what one has learnt. One should have a working understanding of algebra though.",5

15400,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course! The videos were very engaging and interesting, and the instructors did a great job of explaining all kinds of different scenarios involving copyright and how to evaluate the potential use of copyrighted materials. I would highly recommend this course to anyone that might be interested in it!",5
99328,Awesome Course helped me a lot with basics of Angular JS,5
14434,Excellent course that helps you set the foundation for the data science domain.,5
101519,"I think this was a very good course. Level of instruction and pace were appropriate for someone with 2 hours/week to spend and who wanted to improve their knowledge of these topics. Its probably more useful for someone with some previous experience, limited time and some problems they want to solve, rather than a student. It had a good balance between a lot of breadth for time invested. If you approach this as a high-level overview that will help you efficiently focus your own search for knowledge it's extremely well done; I thought knowledge communicated for the amount of time spent was quite high.",5
66390,Very Useful and Well Taught Course!,5
79568,ver good course!!,5

20732,"Nice course, highly effective for other background. I suggest to improve the course content of week 4 & 5 which may be expanded with some other topics.",4
88858,"Good course. It covers various disciplines in philosophy (e.g. of science, of mind, ethics), with interesting presentation and discussion topics. However it doesn't feel very systematic. It feels more like a series of videos about philosophy than a holistic course at philosophy.",4

3153,"This course -- actually, both the 2nd and 3rd courses in this specialization -- are like ""take your interested, but mostly uninformed friend to work day"". Give them some stacks of paper to sort, then shown them what a correctly sorted stack looks like. You've only got one day at work with your friend, so be kind enough to humor them with a very cursory explanation of what sorting is about, but you can't really teach them much in such a short time. So, set them to task, sorting pile after pile. Hey look! Your friend is now a practiced sorter!These courses are really for folks who can spend much more time than advertised. Sure, you will see lots of really cool things -- like AngularJS, Grunt, Bower, etc. -- but don't come into this believing that you'll really learn them, because that is just not possible with the time allowed. This whole thing is about exposure, not deep understanding.Want to learn the guitar? This is like going to watch a (very slow) concert, and then having the guitarist hand you their instrument, put your fingers on the correct frets, and then strum the strings for you. See -- now you can play!Thinking of learning algebra? How about if I simply told you to ""write the numeral 5, then the addition symbol, then the letter X, then the equals symbol, and finally the numeral 12"", and then proceeded to tell you, step-by-step, what you should write on the page in order to solve for X. Would you have learned about solving equations? At most, you would have written a workable example for solving a certain kind of equation, but I doubt you'd be anywhere near proficient after being hand-held through one example.On the positive side, I was exposed to many different things in the web-development world -- that I cannot argue against. However, this course could be so much more. The model of having students watch a video of a person talking about coding, whether in front of a Power Point slide or a text editor full of code, is borrowing from the worst of the ""lecture-first"" classroom experience of (most of) higher ed. It's a bummer that we aren't moving in a different direction with this stuff after so long, but I guess it's still what people expect (or at least have learned to cope with).",2

The only thing driving me nuts was that I couldn't find anything in my notes or even on the web on one of the researchers mentioned in the final test. Dumping my grade.

My toolkit is full and all I need to do now is to start using the tools to bring a change in the way I work and create an impact in the lives of the people I work with.",5
14813,"The course is well structured and provides a good introduction, however, I expected a bit more from a course that costs 20 pounds than just a few clips on how to install and set-up software/create a github account etc. This information is available for free online on the websites of the respective software.I understand that such an introduction is needed for the course, but then do not offer it as a separate 20 pound module. Instead include it for free with any other 'specialization' you can buy.",2

80755,This course is superb!!! I felt a deep connection with the professor while watching his videos. Thank you very much!!! If I ever live in USA I will definitely take some courses in this University,5
85071,Great class as the first one.,5
40317,"I find the discipline very interesting but the course was somewhat boring (except the tasks - the tasks were nice and interesting). The lectures were, to my recollection, the boring piece which reduces the score to 4 out of 5.",4
8864,"I would have rated the course higher if there were a way to practice writing the documents discussed in the lectures. Great introduction to business writing, though. Very accessible to non-business persons.",4
49700,Excellent introduction to the IoT concept.,5

78778,Nice introductory course.,4
99242,"This course is taught very well, and I'm now at my ease with AngularJS. Thanks a lot Mr Yaakov...",5
100880,"I gained a lot from this course, but perhaps not as much as expected even considering it is a fundamentals course. I had hoped to learn a bit more depth, rather than the few basic concepts actually covered. That being said, the instructor did mention at the very beginning which aspects would be skipped and which would be covered, and those covered were covered very well, with the possible caveat that the instructor tended to teach as standard methods that were her preference or background. Additional research on my own turned up a wider variety of PM techniques that were not even mentioned.Overall, worth taking, especially as a very basic introduction for those who (like me) had no previous PM experience.",3
29624,"Comprehensive, well-designed and easy to work with.",5
62335,good learning,5
95361,"Course is good. I'd like to see more code assignments, because the pandas basics should be studied in more details, IMHO.",5
63883,This is my first course completed successfully on Coursera. I really appreciate the hard work of Prof.Fitzpatrick and other teachers. This course made me go from knowing nothing firsthand about MATLAB to being a beginner.,5
59303,I reviewed all the lectures before my job interviews. Perfect online course!,5
38723,Great course! with excellent labs and more...,5
77719,it's too long sentence to verification and we need to write it again,4

86257,Great! :),5
71137,"The grading seems to round up to 100%, which makes the assignments that are already generally easy far too easy. I took this course instead of just doing my own thing so that I could get some structure and motivation. While there was some structure, it was quite basic, and the motivation was diminished by ""good enough"" not being much. I was considering taking the later courses in the specialization, but I'm afraid that without real grading I won't learn as much as if I learn more slowly outside of Coursera.",3
49379,Excellent introduction to Korean. The course has a very clear structure and the workload is manageable.,5
38255,"There was some really great information presented, but mixed in with tangential and unimportant sources (I don't care about the fashionable aspects of IoT!!)",3
90179,"This course is good, but maybe it is a little bit to easy and only cover a small part of knowledge. However, I think it's okay for a introduction course. I hope there will be course dig into more deeply and wilder knowledge",5
87318,"Good initial overview to the topic. Most code is actually provided to the student, preventing deeper learning via trial & error. However, it is a tradeoff of making the course accessible to a large number of students versus being too challenging and preventing newcomers from enjoying the subject. Dr. Severance is excellent -- entertaining and clearly very knowledgable. For any novice programmers looking to understand how Python can be used to access the web and scrape its data, this is the best place to start.",5
44159,Good stuff. I learned some useful techniques,3
106153,"Great, challenging course",5
76896,Thank Dr. Chuck a lot.,5
80212,"This is a good approach on learning the PMBOK guide, gives you the perfect insight on how to stud the guide. Explained everything in an easy manner with good exposure by using different live examples. Easy way to achieve the PDU's for the PMP exam.",5
17664,Just the right knowledge that a beginner like me needs,5
40630,"I loved the course. Very clearly step by step, I could review my current situation, and the tips that were given were clean, ethical ways of handling people we find difficult to deal with in life. It was more like a self empowerment course.Both the facilitators were awesome, people I learnt to relate with within 4 weeks time. Their expertise and experience showed in each of their classes. The examples and experiments used were eye openers and very interesting. I watched and heard them more than once.I enjoyed the course thoroughly... Thank you!",5
88952,"It's a great introduction to the variety of philosophical topics, being introductory it just scratches the surface though. Could be made more interesting, but nonetheless a good course to get started with philosophy.",4
43544,"I'm grateful that I have bumped into this course. The ideas delivered are life changing. So little attention is paid to HOW WE LEARN, though we love to celebrate the good students and chastise the 'bad' ones. This set of ideas which could be described as a primer in neuroscience, and a set of techniques that make you learn more efficiently and joyfully, SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS. What are we waiting for?",5
43892,"I would basically recomend this course to anyone interested in improving his learning skills, in any area. It is simple, yet effective and deep in its lessons. Here is truly an oportunity to change your life by changing your learning habits and techniques.",5

106854,"I did the MOOC just to break the ice and have a general idea about this world of writing for young audiences. I think the course is fair and quite complete, has some very interesting insights, and the videos as very informative and the perfect lenght (by the time your head can't take more info, they are over). Thank you very much, it has been a pleasure.",4
76435,Wonderful course for people who want to startoff with programing but do not have a basic knowledge of programing& wonderful clase for Phyton basicsbit slow for people who know programing but want to learn only phyton,5
5864,One of th best Courses on Coursera.,5

64038,You learn from zero and become almost and expert in MATLAB without noticing. Highly recommended.,5
30224,"the peer grading system is poor, considering that they are learning just like us.the grading should be done automatically or by a professional .",1
61208,best course I have ever attended both online or in class,5
102026,"Very informative course. I love the way the course has balanced theoretical knowledge and practical application of the same. Happy to make the decision to join this course. Thanks Prof. Randy Hlavac, Northwestern University Team & Coursera",5

46009,Excellent by content and composition. Highly recommended.,5
56818,"A great introductory ML course. It does skips all the mathematical proofs (LA stuffs), so you don't really know what's going on behind the scenes, but it concentrates more on application (works for me!). After taking this course, I do recommend taking a more applied ML course (computer vision, NLP, etc.).",5
98690,"Relevant materials, but lecture delivery is rather dry,",3
59987,"Awesome instructor, and content. Tough course, but worth the time.",5

49659,"Course address some elementary issues about IoT, but the instructor at times seems like he does not have a good grasp of the lecture materials. No access to quizzes or evaluations as auditing participant, which is a shame since most of the Coursera MOOCs allow access to evaluation material under the auditing modality.",2

19292,"This is an extraordinary course that teaches valuation of projects. As usual, Prof Kaul builds on the basic building blocks of valuation and makes us fall in love with the concepts. He then possibly sits back and smiles at us tearing our hair out with the assignments. It is great fun and invaluable learning, especially if you happen to have a non-finance background like I did.",5
100294,Simple and practical guidelines which can be followed easily. I think I will be able to apply the methods discussed in the course on daily basis without actually spending much time on learning them as they are very practical! The course has been useful in making me realize where all my time has been going without quantifiable results and hopefully I will be able to make a habit of good time management. Thank you for putting it together :-),4

15765,"This is the fourth class I've taken in the Creative Writing specialization program. As a whole, I enjoyed the class, with only a few notes to make. As with the other classes in the specialization, I feel the curriculum could be expanded upon, perhaps with assigned readings to help illustrate the points made in the lectures. Another thing I wish to note, albeit a minor one, is that the videos in this course particularly feel a bit cut up. It seems like several takes were combined into one video, which makes the overall presentation feel a bit jerky in comparison to other courses in the program.",4
95772,"Very good course, as a standalone course, some sections are slightly too short, but the information is great, very useful, nicely presented and works when put into practice. Thanks!",4

15692,Advanced my techniques for circuit analysis - great techniques gained,5
48084,"The tone of the course wasn't always to my liking (with the cartoons, animations, etc.) but there is some great advice in here, and I would encourage everyone to take the course. Barb's (the instructor's) personal background particularly resonated with me: she is someone who entered Engineering, a very demanding field, without much science background, and had to adapt to many new and challenging ideas. I am contemplating a similar change, and it's comforting to know that it can be done.",3

37675,I have learned a lot from this course,5
68907,"Excellent course! My only ""complaint"" really is that I wish the instructors would use other tools besides GraphLab. I realize that this does make it a lot easier, but I'm sure many of us work in environments where we cannot use GraphLab (for a variety of reasons) and it would be most helpful it they demonstrated how to accomplish the same thing solely using open source alternatives.",4

73231,awesome lectures!,5
41665,"This class was ultimately great. I struggled a lot with it until week 9 or 10, when we really explained classes. Once I understood a thing I had been blindly using for a while, so much clicked into place for me. I did get frustrated when the homework asked for things that were beyond the lesson, and while I knew how to look up what I needed most of the time, I didn't know how to interpret what I was looking up, so it was useless. Again, after the classes lesson, it all made sense and I was fine and able to do things beyond what was spelled out for me. Even though XNA isn't supported anymore, I still learned a great deal in this class. People were also very helpful on the forums when anyone was stuck on something.",5
97324,"This is a fabulous course, a must take for aspiring and practicing entrepreneurs. Guides you how to survive and swim along the sharks.",5
88518,"Excellent course. The presenter really knows his stuff and presents it with an easy tone and voice. A course like this could be a lot of fluff, but this one has detailed steps and video examples and what to do and what not to do.

I wish I was at JH, taking a class right now from him, or consulting with him. He was very thorough and did an incredible job.

65181,"I am afraid this is going to be a rather negative review. Having completed over 10 Coursera courses over the year, and numerous other online classes, this is officially the worst. For me personally, the whole course was a complete waste of time. Put it simply, the presenter can't teach, at least not the MOOCs. There were no structure. The instructions were all over the place, and explanations were inadequate. After drumming how important to actually ""code"", he proceeded to present the whole lecture showing small pieces of codes.... on slides. After touting how cool and useful Sublime is as a developer tool, he didn't even use it. After telling everyone how useful regular expression is but not part of this course (so he won't explain), he went on to use regular expressions for all the sample codes for the rest of the lecture. As mentioned, there was no structure as to how he present Ruby/Rails as a programming platform. It was bits of code here, bits of code there. Beside getting a feel of what Ruby syntax is like, there was no learning. I am aware there are suggested readings, but then why doing this MOOC at all.As I check out other courses from the same Ruby specialization, the student numbers are getting smaller. Hardly everyone post on the forums, I also check the Classmates map. I suspect many simply gave up since the Intro classes were so bad. It's really not hard to find better material to learn Ruby/Rails, even just slightly better, even YouTube videos. I am frustrated at myself for putting in the effort (really try) and wasted days. I am leaving this course and unlikely to sign up any MOOC from the same team again.",1

6523,"The course is supposed to be very informative. It is in fact. But after I spend hours raising my intellectual level trying to understand what they're talking about, I still have no idea what is the purpose of the meditation.Or rather I have it, but from another source, from a person who's been practicing it for 20 years. In 10 minutes I was given a crystal clear and logical answer on what is was all about. Unfortunately this course doesn't give this answer. It will rather improve your skill of understanding highly intellectual texts and will show you some interesting stuff about the brain.",3
63892,this lesson offer much help for new comers in this domain like me.,5

90877,"All in all the material, videos and assignments were very interesting and they made up an exciting course.However, some of the slides lacked sufficient information on notions or did not make references to supplementary sources. The assignment material (mainly pdfs) sometimes had typos which made solving them a bit confusing and more time consuming without actually being very difficult. Also for both slides and assignments the notations were not always consistent and/or variables disappeared from equations without clear explanations.I hope in the next offering of this course there will be improvements on these aspects.",3

The only thing I would change about the course is that I would have periodic check-up quizzes to help the learner gauge his/her understanding.",4
68012,"Con:(1) I feel I spent most of the time learning graphlab. Suggest replace it with standard Python as the standard tool for this class. Provide any needed additional code in standard Python.(2) Course is better in the front end than in the back end.(3) Week #6 is significantly more involved than previous weeks. Suggest divide Week 6 into two sessions: Neural Network and Nearest Neighbor applying neural network results (ImageNet 2012 was mentioned and not explained. Therefore the Nearest Neighbor homework assignment from the student's perspective does not have much to do with neural network other than using the results from ImageNet 2012, which was not explained in any detail anyway). This will allow more time to delve into the forward and backward propagation which should have been explained in more details.(4) Home assignments are not best worded, especially homework assignment for Week 6. Suggest reword in shorter statements that are more to the point.(5) Programming presentation and assignments can seem like exercise in graphlab and SFrame functions rather than machine learning.PRO:(1) Class presentation by Professor Fox on recommender system is detailed and clear.(2) Classifier block diagram shown by Professor Guestrin is good, clearly distinguishing training the classifier and the subsequent use of the classification (prediction).(3) Neural network quiz in Week 6 is excellent. It drills down on the multi-dimensional space that neural network is particularly good for.",2

50048,This is one of the best Python course in Coursera! Amazing!,5
6207,I think it is a good class overall but the pace is fast and the resources that can help you is lacking. This will be good for someone who already kind of understands bioconductor.,4
41713,"I've learned a few things, because I've already designed a responsive website, but it should be very good for newcomers. I'll definitely change my own approach to design, as he showed - it's good to design mobile-first, but going back and forth multiple devices to show information more clearly is even better.",4
48624,"It's amazing, I've learnt so many things and I haven't even completed the course (yet)! As it goes, it becomes more and more interesting, compelling to complete it and, maybe, even go for a certificate.",5
32868,I am very grateful to everyone for their cooperation and effort specially to my teacher.,5
78527,Good course to start basic programming in Python,4
24825,The course is highly theoretical. Only good for coming to know the terms that are in use in the industry and their meanings. Very little take away from a practical perspective. Some live example or a case study to be incorporated where the students can apply the principles first hand.,2

20069,I appreciate the enthusiasm.Thank you,5
89283,"It's a good course.If I must complain about something is that, since the course covers a little too much too fast, the people that is not familiar with the subject might not understand the why or how of things explained.",4
100446,"This was a wonderful course, I would definitely take this again.",5
5800,The overall course was very good however the edit distance lectures were very fast to grasp the concepts,4
37872,"The course is an excellent satrting guide for anyone who needs a mild introduction to html, CSS and javascript. Most important basics and it moves you to some advanced aspects. Overall you appreciate the concepts more because of the nature of assignments.",5

97557,"Excellent, timely information from a five star instructor.",5
99678,"This course needs a total overhaul; in its current state it is a detriment to both Coursera and the Wharton Online brand. First, there was relatively little content; there was less than an hour of lectures each week and no actual programming involved. Second, the material was pitched at a very basic level, but not in a good way. Third, the tests didn't manage to even test the material being covered. For example, when given a mean and stdev, when asked to find a value, often the lecture would use an approximation ( i.e., a 2-tailed 95% distributed = 2.00 std devs. ) This is a class on excel: there is NO excuse for not introducing norm.s.inv and norm.s.dist when asking that question. When the test required the ""approximation"" rather than the exact calculation? Everything about this course was wrong, it needs to be scrapped and thrown away.",1
66986,While the course does a good job of explaining most things but if you struggle with a problem or a topic support is nearly non existent and offline resources for julia are limited. No one used the discussion forums either unfortunately.,3
100788,Great introduction to a very promising technology!,4
24040,"Fascinatingand slightly scary! Anyone who votes should watch these lectures. Some of the ""correct"" quiz answers are dodgy (illogical factually incorrect) but don't let this discourage you. Also, accepting peer marking is not for those with fragile egos or low frustration levels.",4
50180,Excellent course for individuals inclined toward Western Classical Music. The course offers a great opportunity to learn about some of the finest composers in the history of classical music.,5
50853,prefect presentation of materials and really interesting way of teaching. for the first time of my life i am actually understanding software engineering principles.,5
519,difficult course that is full of information but if anatomy is your 'thing' then this is a very good course to take.,5
28805,It`s perhaps the most beautiful course made by really good people. Thanks to professor raj and coursera.,5
91632,"I felt that weeks 1-4 went at a reasonable pace, but the week 5 material was rushed. Those programs were written by the instructor and presented quickly as examples, but some of the content in the programs was not already known or presently explained, like the ""buffer"" built-in function (found in Chapter 3 of Dr. Chuck's book but not covered in the course) and the ""pass"" keyword, which I had to find in the Python reference manual for an explanation. The week 5 programs were quite advanced and I would have liked more time spent on explaining them and perhaps a related programming assignment or two to help us learn the material.",3
66325,Excellent and highly recommended!,5
60509,Lecture component not as concise or well edited as expected.,3
60988,"The subjects selected are relevant, the professors are very knowledgable, engaging and inspiring and they answer all the questions promptly.I enjoyed this course tremendously, highly recommended!",5

Kudos to the educators teaching and utilizing this information, and to Coursera for offering such a gem",5
103024,"The content is great, and the lectures are clear, but this course was made in a rush: there are many bugs throughout the quizzes and there is no contact at all with the lecturer in the forums, and there is no teaching stuff present in the forums.",5
65523,great course on Fashion and Luxury that helping putting the right words on thr tight concepts and clarify Business Models,4
13860,"Despite Finance is not among the subject that interest me the most, the topics of the course are very well explained and help build the knowledge about the concepts in a easey way. Above of that, everything is explained in relation to the construction industry, from real state development or highways construction.",5
1258,"The course contents and assignments are clear and well-structured. Compared to the algorithms & data structures courses, this one was a lot easier (for me anyway). I would have liked additional content on, for instance, (Markovian) grids/fields, but perhaps this will be covered in the 'advanced algorithms' course.",4
86082,"Too basic, not enough coverage of topics discussed.",3
61929,Excellent course with very useful contents. Professor gives excellent examples,5
22254,"A fun way to end the courses.About the reading material for all of the courses - please proofread and edit the reading material. There are so many grammatical errors and typos that it made it difficult to read. (The non-word ""wanna"" was used many times!)",5
70408,"The course comes with great explanation but the graded assignments sometimes seem pointless as they look irrelevant to the topic, There are unnecessary questions asked in quizzes i.e whether you have completed your assignment or not. These sort of questions never evaluate what we have accomplished",4
78335,Great course with an amazing professor !,5
47689,very insightful techniques from the course. very impressive.,5
1306,The best course I have taken so far for introducing algorithms. I must say the exercises and programming interview questions made the course more interesting and thoroughly tested my understanding. Cheers to the instructors and the team !!!,5

6925,"100% worth your time ! Astronomy is my passion, and I wanted to apply my knowledge elsewhere while at the same time enhancing my understanding for the subject. I hope to do some form of Astronomy/Astrophysics course at university and this online course has been perfect in helping me to discuss my extra work/reading around the subject.",5
29360,Excellent course; thoroughly enjoyed.,5
42075,"I had to keep pausing the videos because he kept rushing through the material. The notes that appeared on the sides were very hopeful, but rarely stayed on the screen long enough for me to write down the first note! It was very informative and interesting.I WOULD recommend this to someone else, however I really wish that the notes stayed on the screen either as he talks (until he gets to a new topic. EX. Egypt VS. Babylon- the whole topic of Egypt VS. Babylon the notes for it are on the side of the screen. When it gets to the next topic-- say Neo-Babylonians, the notes for that topic appear ), or just long enough for people to read the notes and copy them down.",4
98535,"The instructor's presentations are so irritating due to him acting in a jumpy, nervous, and hyper-excited manner that I could not stand watching the lectures. If you don't mind that, it's probably not a bad course.",2
47087,"Currently I'm MD graduated and pass my first board the last year and now I'm studying to complete all my boards, and this course actually is helping me to be a better learner now comparated with before, the techniques and advices related how to learn more efficiently and deep are excellent.",4

655,Good Planning methodologies and examples,5
105247,"Assignments are good-intended, but I am not sure how helpful they are, as they are really boring and unnecessarily time-consuming. I do not know how could one make them better. In contrast, the videos are really good, they are worth your time even if you know your way around these things.",4

106787,"While I found the content and instructors to be very good, I don't feel I received any true constructive criticism that will help me with my writing. I would have preferred having an instructor review my work and provide proper feedback. I understand it costs to have someon",3
62141,This has been such a great experience. I feel truly blessed!,5
61091,Great simple lessons that directly increase your financial intelligence and investing prowess. I highly recommend this course to everyone especially young adults fresh out of high school. I learned very valuable lessons on how to manage my money that even a lot of other adults and people my age never learned. It has a cheesy presentation but this course is the real deal if you want to learn about how to manage your money.,5
57741,This is really good course to start to learn machine learning.,5

27661,"feels great, to know about such a renowned personality like Einstein. feeling like i came closer to Einstein and his work, but more than that it i feel closer and connected to the universe. this all has become possible only because of professor Lary Lagerstrom's unique teaching skills and presentation of subjects. myself being from science background found it very easy to get hold of what is actually going, but i'm 100% positive that any person from any background can understand and successfully complete this course. thank you professor.",5
104553,It's not worth the price.,1
27615,Mandatory,5
56996,"I really liked the course has been developed and delivered by Prof Andrew Ng. The course is cleverly designed to accommodate people at different skill levels. While the videos, assignments and lecture notes are very valuable and free to access, it would be more encouraging for people to join the Machine Learning working community if the certificate fee is lesser than what it is now. Thanks to Coursera, Prof Andrew Ng and all the volunteers.",5

49523,thanks its amazing,5
57570,"The course is most useful for students not in the maths/engineering field. As a medical student with only high school maths and computing, I am happy to learn just enough to explore real problems in my field. It does not assume previous knowledge in advanced linear algebra, multivariable calculus and Matlab programming. I'm able to go through the whole course and finish the assignments in just 2 weeks. In contrast, I am unlikely to be able to go through the other online ML courses by famous universities or even the youtube version of Prof. Andrew Ng.",5
62011,"This is an excellent survey of the long 19th Century through WW II with a marvelous ' lagniappe' of very thoughtful coverage to 2013. I think that covering the events of the last two generations is very difficult without the credibility gained via a consistent approach to what came before. This course provided that consistency.I now have a new appreciation of 'what came before' and a reminder, thanks to Philip Zelikow, to resist the constraint of thinking only via the history, outlooks and ideas of my lifetime.Highly recommended.",5
26217,"Too sample , and I would expect more in detail.",2
35243,very good framework to understand and build teams but also with very actionable tools in a day-by-day job reality,5
20619,"Good course, very well structured, well signposted, progressive, very clear, with a good use of the media. As for the content, the examples are not always well connected to the theory. The speakers speak at a good pace, not too slow not too fast but their tone is monotonous and it is a little bit formal. Therefore the course is a little dull. As the course is very introductory, it would have been nice to be directed to other more advanced courses either online or residential.",4
40535,"Very good, interesting and essential course. Everybody should know the Earth's climate basics since everybody is living on Earth",5

31842,Dr Shane Dixon is a star!!!!!!,5
69650,"Peking University's Chinese for Beginners course has been very interesting and comprehensive in covering the basics that would be truly useful and stimulating for beginners. The course has had simple yet adequate approach in teaching and assessing students' learning. For better practicing of conversations and lessons, it might be helpful if actual dialogues between the lecturer and a co-teacher were presented for the students to hear and learn from.",5

32845,It was awesome!! I learned a lot with my own pace!!,4
74536,Good course for beginners who has no experience in programming. An introduction to python and basic programming concepts. I think it is too easy for someone with a programming background.,5
12159,Interesting .,5
32549,"The most rich course in the specialization, till now, containing very helpful tools and insights.",5
78511,"I am very disappointed with this programming course. The course lacks detail and deepth and could be taught in 45 to 60 minutes instead of 7 weeks. The quizzes and assignments were to easy and basic (solved in less than 5 minutes) and definitely not enough. Annoying was the overuse of colours in almost every video (almost everything was coloured - highlighting everything is just as usefull as highlighting nothing, green box with white text inside - did you try to read that on a different monitor than yours?), the pointless and useless doodles, smilies and whatsoever, wasting my time by watching you dispose your teabag/drinking tea or coffee/talking about your mug/etc., why do you even need to drink in a 20 minute-or-less video. The Tutor tried to loosen a dry topic. Mostly it wasn't my humor but I can live with that. I had hoped for more :(",1
43889,"Very useful course, it brings new informations about learning and I can guarantee you that it'll help you in others courses and much more. It has completely changed my journey through learning.",5
58090,"My only complaint is the lack of vectorization in many of the lectures. I understand that linear algebra may be foreign to many programmers, but the tutorials which vectorize made the course much more clear. Overall, this is a great course.",5
76361,awesome lecturer and content thnx for your time!!!!,5
20090,Yes! It adds more stars to my bachelors degree in mechanical engineering pursuit,5

I will have this in my mind when it gets hard, sometimes to learn new things!Thank you both very much!!! And it have been funny!Kjell Karlsson",5
23586,Great course on nutrition.It highlights the key concepts and gives a good knowledge of the food industry. It also enables us to understand the major problems related to food & health as well as how to tackle them.,5
24258,It is an excellent course. Professor LaGrange has an extraordinary skill to facilitate the understanding of the fundamentals of fluid-solid interactions. Every week of the course combines theory and experimental demostrations in a very balanced way. The visual images accompanying the equations and the summaries at the end of the sessions are great course assets. Without any doubt I will enroll in a future sequel of this course.,5

13376,I didn't learn many data science concepts in this class,2
56484,Very nice course.,5
69865,"I'll say the same about this class as the rest of the specialization, if you have the skills to complete this course then you don't need to take this course. If you don't have the skills to complete this course, you will not complete this course. The course instruction is at 10000 feet level and the assignments are very challenging and the course will NOT teach you the skills required to complete the assignments.I recommend the Machine Learning Course (from Bill's colleagues) at University of Washington. That is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignments (though still very challenging).",2
11596,A well presented capstone to the Graphic Design series.,5
48986,The course gives a lot of good informations that engineers should know in the everyday life. The professor James Shackelford explain the subjects in a very clear and objective way with a lot of practical examples.,5
61991,It is a unique course and I wish that all people heard Professor Philip Zelikows lectures,5

98145,"Love the way the professor introduces the concepts, doesn't overwhelm the student!",5
72674,"Amazing - way more depth than the first course, and much narrower focus. Emily teaches all courses here and dives into the math and usage. Programming hints are given but no more walkthroughs of the code. Assignments laid out such that you need to code the algorithms correctly in order to pass assignments. Emily has an excellent way of explaining the math/calculous/reasoning behind the algorithms and proofs thereof. Love it.",5
4485,"Amazing volume of topics covered and in a manner that is not overly complicated in terms of testing methodology, but still requires you to do the work. There are still several bugs with the course, test answers and instruction documents on the site, but clearly the course is new so hopefully that will be resolved in coming iterations of the class.",4

105234,Great! Very Well Structured,5
68872,"At times, this course feels like an extended advertisement for Graphlab Create, which was founded by one of the instructors. The case studies are all quite interesting, however. I would not recommend this course, except that the following course is awesome and this course is helpful preparation for the regression course. The best part of this course is the interaction between the instructors, who are very fun.",4
27850,Great instructor and lessons. I love the organisation of the course and it really provides a great basis for looking deeper into aspects of graphic design! Looking forward to doing the other courses in this specialisation.,5
53570,"This course was an amazing, memorable journey. I started off feeling slightly intimidated by the programming aspect since I am not from an Computer Science/Engineering or Math/Statistics background. To my surprise, however, the lectures really gave me a flavor of the ""bigger picture"" or the intuition behind each of the learning algorithms, and the programming exercises helped me apply the knowledge and really grow as a problem-solver. I highly recommend this course to anyone who is looking to become familiar with a cutting-edge, exciting field that is sure to become very much mainstream in the near future.",5
63192,Really good information for people starting companies and figuring out how to lead manage future employees. Some of the videos were cut off at the end and a word misspelled on the quiz. Other than that great job keep up the great work!,4

17718,I would have liked a bit more detail and some more examples from business perspective. But I am sure there will be a more advanced course that I could take.,4
79632,"I found this course in the suggestions list after taking Introduction to Music Production with Loudon Stearns. I audited it, so I couldn't/didn't do the assignments but I found it really interesting so I binge-watched the lectures in the space of a day. The way the course is set up as compared to Intro to Music Prod. it is a lot less detailed technical instruction and more of a broad look at the artistic/aesthetic/philosophical components of various aspects of music production. And since Loudon touches upon this in the other course, I would say the two courses nicely complement each other and are both worth watching all the way through. I think they could be taken in any order, but personally, even though Intro is more technical, I think I got more out of this one having already taken Intro. Even as someone who considers myself pretty good as far as lyrics/songwriting/composition, I still got something new and useful out of those parts and liked the way the instructor put these ""creative"" parameters in concrete terms. The way he talked about and clarified Vision, Identity, and Intention I personally found very empowering, interesting, and practically useful. I feel like some of these ideas had been floating around in my mind before, but it validated that they were valuable things to be thinking about. There are a couple specific things that popped up in the course that are really cool and useful: for example, the rule of threes, and the information on panning, delay, mixing, etc. Very glad I found it! I hope these keep being offered for free because I find them more efficient for learning than some YouTube videos, and at some point I would consider doing one not just audited but ""for real.""",5
47795,"This was a fun, and, enlightening course that really helps!",5

65249,"I have been learning ruby on rails for a year now, introduction to ruby in this course helped me a lot in understand ruby programming classes and it's object orientation. Course explained a lot why i need to be ruby expert to shine as rails developer.It also helped me to understand lot of stuffs which i did blindly in rails before, like adding attr_accessor in class etc., are actually from ruby.I'm glad I found this course. Looking forward to do next module.",5
8198,"It is hard to be constructive when you do have something brilliant to compare with.The very first thing to say is that the course is presented through poorly drawn cartoons for 5-year-olds and ineffective lecture videos with little or no eye contact with the instructors. The presentations are filled with strange icons and drawings appearing every here and there, making not much of a professional impression.After watching videos, in just about 5 minutes after the lecture is over, the retained information was always going to zero. Sometimes I had to rewind the video to retrieve the points they were trying to make. Or maybe I just didn't want to listen to them. But it seems impossible due to the fact I am interested, and I do finish every course on Business writing I run into. Always with 100% final grade.The overall demeanor is not as professional as it has to be. I recommend the designers to watch ""Write Professional Emails"" with Gerry Landers by Georgia Tech and ""Teach English Now!"" with Dr. Shane Dixon by Arizona State University. I do not normally remember the instructors' names, except for brilliant ones. I do not remember the ones of this course.I do hope my criticism will eventually lead to a better experience for your students. I apologize if I was overly direct and wordy.Regards,Rafael",1

19882,"very good course. One thing, the 7 days to retake the exam, I see it is long time",5
92006,"Short, but jam packed with stuff you need to know in order to get working with Databases. The ending lesson was a little disappointing as we weren't tested on how to do some of the suggested projects that the teacher was talking about and instead only had to download and run a program on our computer. However, this class equips you with the knowledge to get a start in Data Science and Database engineering, as well as good practice and better understanding of how to use Python.",4

18698,"This course is very informative, it discusses a broad of things regarding digital manufacturing, and it can put you on the right track by letting you know about the industrial revolutions, where are you standing, and which field do you want to proceed and work in. I recommend it to anyone who wants to start a career in manufacturing, even those who are already in the field and want to refresh their information or to know broader information regarding what they are missing, or want to upgrade their factory's systems. I recommend it also to engineering students, and young technicians. Good luck everyone!",5
70754,"Pefrect course for beginners like myself. Everything was really well explained but not too slow either, the way things were presented was easy to follow, but also interesting; touching subjects close to real life problems we might encounter. Last, but not the least (on contrary), lecturers were really easy to listen, they explained everything well, but the feeling wasn't too strict or overly professional. It was a joy. :)",5

54886,"A great introductory course that is designed such that you don't need a mathematical background in order to understand the concepts. Due to its attempt to maximise accessibility, most concepts are not mathematically motivated, meaning that a person serious about pursuing this as a career will need to do a subsequent course that is more mathematically rigorous.

My goal was to understand the fundamentals and uses of Bayesian statistics, having attempted that via a couple of textbooks without much success; this time, I got it!I do have some reservations about the course. Herbie Lee spent a huge amount of time deriving formulas and methods - a few gaps (either hand waving or 'leave it to the student to finish') would have been helpful, I think. This would leave more time for examples and applications. But the course was well worth my time and effort.",4
72412,"This course is very helpful to really get a taste of the financial models used for investing. If you are one of those who love to break down a problem and base your decisions on an in depth analysis, then this is the course for you. This course only talks about stocks and not other financial securities, however the main advantage of this course is that you would learn concepts, ideas and logics that could very well be extended to other financial securities. The course is easy to understand but it is always a good idea to have basics of economics and mathematics brushed up beforehand.",4

59232,The concepts are explained masterfully with a focus on understanding rather than high-level mathematics which most of these topics invariably deal with. Plus the exercises give a real feel for the practical questions that Machine Learning can solve and the method that practitioners use most often.,5

31908,a bit tedious but lots of information,4
17272,"Overall I enjoyed this course and got a broad overview of the various technologies used in big data analysis. The course is video heavy but short on practice. There are 3 assignments the first 3 weeks, then week4 is an endless series of videos. I really enjoyed the assignments but felt there should have been more assessment/practice provided -there are no quizzes to reinforce understanding. The readings provided are mostly academic ones which aren't that clear to beginners (even to programmers like me).In contrast, a Python data science course on another MOOC platform has 4 times as much content with practice exercises after every video, mid and final exams, weekly problem sets as well as readings.Ultimately the course showed me what I need to learn next to get into Data Science but the first course hasn't given me confidence that the rest of the specialization will be worth the money.",3
104960,"Homework, lectures, and the quiz are completely out of sync. Bayes rule is introduced and appears in the homework but no where else. Things appear on the quiz that aren't in the home work or lecture. This was put together from scraps of another lecture, but in an incoherent fashion. When Caffo tells the viewer that they'll need to use other resources, he wasn't kidding. I dropped this the first time when I kept introducing things that completely had not been introduced, took another stats class, then came back and aced it. I don't mind accelerated learning or using other resources, but there's guide for which concepts are needed and where coverage for them can be found. This leaves little recourse but to know stats already, or go learn it before taking this course. Otherwise you don't know enough to even go find the pieces you need. Incidentally, the dude who does the lectures for Khan Academy does a fantastic job and the lectures are a joy to watch, though some people might prefer something that moves less slowly and carefully and perhaps they would prefer something that glosses over the fundamental concepts more. If that's the case, I can't say enough good things about Biostatistical Analysis by Zar but thoroughly, logically categorizing statistical methods with short, clear examples, references to the original research, and building up one concept after another in logical order. The chapters are short, but the first 16 or so should give you a good enough foundation to deal with about any intro stats class. As it is, Caffo's presentation needs some serious testing and remodeling, but there's no indication that it'll match what Khan Academy did regardless of how much work goes in. At best, it's a bitter pill you can swallow if you already know the concepts.",1
59978,"Well worth the time, not only is the lecturer very good at communicating the concepts, but he also has real-world experience, and it shows.",5

94969,Very good course. It has transformed my approach to career development. Before I was not sure about how to manage my career and I was trying to learn a lot of skills without thinking about how to use them. This course has provided me with the tools and methodology that I need to be more strategic and focused in my career management.,5

4880,five star course. really enjoying the presentations,5
93605,"The video lectures will help you to pass the quizzes, as they are primarily theory and background. The lectures will not, however, aide you in any way in completing the programming assignments. The first programming assignment is extremely difficult and very little is done in the lectures, the textbook, or in swirl to pull all of the pieces together prior to the first programming assignment/quiz. There are so many disparate concepts, that it would be nice if the instructor could at the very least, demonstrate a full analysis of some kind of tabular data in R. How to properly import the data, create the file, structure the data, and then perform some analysis. These concepts are introduced throughout the course, but never brought together in one complete project.",1

93289,This course is awesome. It gets you the skills you need to do data analysis in faster and smarter ways,5
58170,"Nice beginner level course. Shows the big picture without dwelling much into nitty-gritty. Basic knowledge of Linear Algebra would not hurt but that's not necessary. Needless to say, Prof Andrew's teachings/advices were fabulous during the course. Programming assignments were mostly trivial. They can be made a bit challenging. Thanks.",4

100747,"Quality of the video and sound are bad; a few minutes after starting a lesson, sound goes off or picture holds and moves no more... This made me stop the course.",1
8952,It was an excellent course for me. It was my first course in Coursera and it won't be the last one. Thanks teachers because every session was helpful and understandable.,5
7604,"There was a lot of very valuable information in the course, and I very much liked the general structure. However, maybe it was due to my career and family background, but there was also plenty of information that I had mistaken as common knowledge. Apparently I have more knowledge in this area than I assumed.Overall, this was a very interesting course, and the combination of the videos and smart board graphics helped keep things interesting. I would very much recommend Child Nutrition and Cooking!",4

67065,"This class was extremely disappointing. While the material is interesting and the mathematics and computer science are excellent, the format of the course makes substantive learning difficult. The crux of the course is based on lecture videos. Unfortunately, the videos amount to the professor simply reading off Powerpoint slides with occasional quizzes in the video. There are only 4 programming assignments, the first of which demanded a total of 2 new lines of code. Later assignments are more involved, but there are still only 4 of them. I for one only learn effectively when the class is engaging. That means slightly more dynamic lectures, more involved assignments. I don't learn or retain anything meaningful from powerpoints and multiple-choice quizzes, and I know that many agree. If you're the kind of person who can learn from reading a powerpoint slide, then you'll be fine. I got nothing out of this course.",1

The pace can be slow, but of course you can always speed up the videos. The mathematics is very approachable - school level algebra is all you need. The only other prerequisite is a basic understanding of light and electromagnetic waves.",4

It was very helpful to gain a base understanding around big data and the potential insight and uses that come from tapping into it.In terms of the assignments and projects, I think the strategic approach to helping firms tap into insights from big data was a little bit vague.",4
23198,GREAT CLASS,5
97586,Theoretically the course is very lacking. There is little focus on the scholarly work in the field except perhaps the first few lectures. The content and scope of the course is too small. Overall however the content is good for a very basic introduction and,3

68468,"The instructors are great and the material logically detailed. The only problem is feed back or lack thereof. The assignments are hard for a person who has minimal computer skills as described in the outline, so having someone to go to for questions, especially the programming parts are essential and this is lacking unfortunately. Apparently, and I don't want to put words in someone else's mouth, but the assumption is that the fellow students will have the missing information and that they will actually answer them. That is not the case unfortunately. So even though I emailed the instructors with no response, I managed to obtain some information from other student who were extremely dedicated and much more advanced. I may have entered the course at a minimal personnel time which may account for my perceived difficulty. However, from some of the griping, I am not alone. On the other one gets what they pay for and I was overall glad to take the course and respect all the aspects except for the one already mentioned.",3

I was such a dumb that I didn't have these great techniques and I just wasted my 3 year college life. When I recall my college life, I just didn't learn much. I just went for the exams. It's pathetic honestly; however, now I have learned the GREAT tools from this class that I am going to teach all to my brother who is a sophomore in college now, and learning never ends that I can apply all the tools into my life long learning.

46019,"Taking it again, as I loved it in previous session. Thanks for doing such a good job, all for free.",5
24518,"Very easy to understanding and practical, especially for the beginners like me. It give me confidence to go further.",5
8351,I cannot complete the course due to installations problem of the software required even if I have all the requirements needed on my laptop.,1
93659,"there is a huge distance between what you teach in the videos, which is fine, and the programming assingments which seem to be apt at an expert audience.to solve these problems I have to spend hours and hours on the internet looking at other people doing similar projects or asking for help.I agree that by looking you can get insight into what you are doing, but the lessons need to be built little by little and supported by practice.You can't slam me with these cache problems giving me an example that is hard to understand (much harder than anything seen during class) and expect me to do it in 5 hours per week. Maybe 5 hours per day.Disappointed. I wanted to use the whole course to learn about rprogramming but I will most likely try to get back the money I spent on this and let it go.",1

99274,An excellent way to learn Angular...theory & practice.,5
100920,"I did learn the basics, but will need to go on and learn more in depth. I'd also like to have more written materials to go with the videos. I know I can download the video transcript, but what I'd like is actual handouts that are organized. I am more of a written/visual learner and need to read to retain information.",3

1887,Great course,5
64720,"Content is 5 for sure. The fact that they keep suggesting to go for a verified course however is a little bit annoyig, so 1 star off for that. I think it would be more appropriate to give an option to disable future asking similar to how ratings on Android work. That being said, the course is excellent I'm taking this for pure fun and it really is, ... fun! :D",4

100147,Great course - you'll find here many helphul things in very interesting lectures.,5
49853,"I love Prof. Areti!! She's amazing! This is first time I've come so far in any course I've taken in Coursera; partly because programming is actually fun, but also because this course is structured beautifully to teach students how to understand the logic behind programs and implement &/or improvise the same concepts in their own creations. With this, I shall say I am determined to complete the Code Yourself! course :)",5
48342,"One of the bests ways of understanding the GR ant it's mathematical's tools. The apresentation of the class ( The ""blackboard"" ) is very impressive and helps the student in calculations . Thank You!",5

78090,I think the best course on programming here at Coursera.,5
14823,Too expensive for what you get :(,1
78701,"The course was very basic. It was nicely taught and the examples and the lectures were really enjoyable. However, some shortcomings I felt were that the colors in the slides could have been a bit clearer. Another thing was that some concepts were introduced in the lectures which were not explained completely. A real beginner would not be able to understand them which would in some parts defeat the purpose of the course.Other than that, I felt the course was really structured well. The assignments were easy and the quizzes did test the knowledge about the subject taught so far. It was such that any new person would not feel discouraged.Keep up the good job people.",4
87457,It is very good explained. Nothing more to say. Thanks for this good course.,5

80974,"Really useful, though some of the ADR methods are not common in my city, still pretty good.",5
64556,"Wow, what a fantastic class. I love how Philip doesn't just talk about a bunch of dates, but really brings in humor, paintings, poems or things from literature, and really does a great job of painting a global view. But it doesn't feel overwhelming considering the topic. Things are presented in an easy-to-understand way each class, and you can tell he really likes this topic, as I found myself more and more interested in all that he was presenting. That's the sign of a great teacher.",5

67317,Very interesting course. It helped me to start studying about the neuromarketing topic.,5
308,Definitely good course for those working in either accounting or analytics. It gave me new ideas on how to apply analytical methods. Interesting examples on how to identify number management and how analytics can help to set up non-financial metrics that drive financial outcomes.,4
15704,There is no feedback on quizzes. and no the moderators evidently do not monitor traffic in the dis.,5

77530,"Excellent course! Professor Chuck's explanations are clear, and he's a fun guy!",5
83499,"Dr Charles Severance is so adorable and I do enjoy his class. Initially I thought python must be not easy to learn, but I gradually absorbed the knowledge and built a solid foundation for more complex programming.",5
9428,"This course is extremely interesting. I found (and understood thanks to the simple and concrete explanations) so many things about maths that I didn't know. Nevertheless this cannot prepare you to take an exam at university (it's unthinkable to learn all about Calculus One in 10-minutes-videos!), but it can surely help you fill lacks on your knowledge of mathematics and fix many doubts. The professor is without any doubt really knowledgeable, and he knows how to increase interest in the audience. I can also say that his English is easily comprehensible (considering I'm not native English-speaker).Thanks for this course!",5
41804,It's very interesting to learn new things.,5
66286,"Great course! Really impressive collaboration with other universities, government agencies, and cultural institutions (and MEC). Wish another week or two could be devoted to social and cultural themes, but really good to see historical content from beyond Western European perspectives.",5

30209,I learned a lot from this course.,5
40521,"I recommend the course, for anyone who understands some math and science. The quizzes and writing exercises were challenging in different ways, and helped me to develop my skills in computing, understanding, looking at data, and practice sharing in the enterprise of science.I would give my performance maybe a B since I did very well in some areas (I understood the science very well, and mainly aced the quizzes) but not so well in others (in the writing assignments I kept getting into trouble with the deadlines and the interface, and in grading other people's papers sometimes I wasn't very thoughtful in my judgments and statements.)Also, I said I understood the science very well, but also I know I could have looked more thoroughly at some parts of the science. Especially about the analysis of radiation as it interacts with the atmosphere, I think I went too fast, and relied on looking at a graph to get myself through the lesson. I am sure the graph has a solid foundation, but I would like to review that part of the course or look at that information more deeply.There is a term project at the end that took me by surprise and I procrastinated on it - bad habit.I decided to go ahead and purchase the course since I am willing to support the course. My finances are really not good but considering the amount of time I put into the course, I should be able to afford that much.",5
96604,"This course is very good. I took me from zero Bootstrap to a very competent level. I was even able to make a side website project that I now use at work. There are minor things that are not explained, but extra material is provided, so no problem.",4
102063,"Great course, great resources!",5
7353,"I found this class to be doable with a 2-month-old infant. I enjoyed the reading. My older kids, ages 7 and 11 enjoyed the videos with me. The class helped our family have many great conversations about what we see at the grocery store and why we cook at home as much as we can.",5

96498,"This course took me from barely understanding html5 and js to being able to create (with help) navbars, drop-downs, breadcrumbs, carousel, modals, thumbnail inserts, and a lot more. I also learned to use Brackets, a very helpful code editor. Instruction was thoroughly organized, and I never, ever found a syntax error in the code Prof. Muppala provided. I am looking forward to the next course in this full-stack series.",5
60561,Highly recommended. It's a self-paced course but you'll get more out of it by enabling deadlines to keep you on track.,5
28043,Really empressive,5
92481,One of the best courses I have done until now in coursera. It is well organized and presented and provide a lot of real examples of serious games to have a clear idea about this topic. Totally recommendable!,5

88502,"I am very thankful for the opportunity to attend this course. Given information in it is too valuable, although I'd wish the course was more extensive. Separetely I want to admit the mastery of a teacher - George Everly, who gave information qualitatively and made interesting video stimulations.

21902,"R is really just the worst, and the instructors do not make it better. The code in this class is unreadable:- too many one liners, because ""it's faster to write"", though harder for other people to read- variables are named cryptic things like spIns or x, rather than names with meaning (eg, sprays.by.insect), again ""because it's faster to type""- way too many cases of ""there is more than one way to do it"", which just makes things confusing because the other ways tend not to be equivalentWhat I'm most concerned about is that I've seen lots of poorly written code in many different languages: Java, C++, C, Python, Perl, and now R. But I've also seen really well-written code in all the languages *but* R, I have yet to see any code in R that is flexible, maintainable, and clear. Which leads me to think that no such code exists, or it's so rare that it doesn't matter. It is clear to me that if I am to do data analysis, then I will need a different set of tools; but because this specialization is taught entirely around R (the lectures are about R, not about higher-level concepts), then this specialization is not useful to me.",1
69641,the classes are sometimes extremely boring and some things are not clearly explained,2

77150,"This introductory course to the Python programming language boosted my confidence in my ability to learn programming for data analysis. Without any prior background in programming and just a bit of algebra several years ago in college, I was able to make it through this course fairly easily. The time estimate for each week accurately reflected the amount of time required for me to complete an assignment. After completing this first course in the Specialization, I decided to sign-up for the entire five-course series.",5

47878,Very worthwhile course. Provides very clear and practical systems for tackling complex projects or subjects.,5
94609,"I encourage all my friends in research to not do anything before doing this course! The pedagogical touch is different to any stats classes I've been on or stats MOOCs I've taken. After many lectures, I was just left staring at the screen, with the phrase ""I must tell everyone"" repeating in my head :)",5
106579,"Overall, the contents are too fluffy and not very tangible. I appreciate though putting the tools into action and having to work on the competitive position assignment, it provides great insights on what matters in a competitive market. As an optimization proposal I suggest to cover the resources of week one, like terms and formulas. That is much more crucial than some of the fluffy contents. Also the companies discussed during the course should not be more known global companies (like Redhook, or the food market examples), hence not to restrict it to USA.",3
8313,"A very good introduction to the Big Data world. Learning videos and supporting materials well prepared, quizes balanced, instalation guide for Hadoop was also perfect.",5

13596,Good explanations and resources.,5
13094,"Very good practical introduction to key competitive strategies concept. Professor Kretschmer provides real company examples that further illustrate and reinforce the concepts. The course does not delve into the theories behind the key concepts which may it quite fluid (though leave certain student asking for more. Course is well articulated, relatively easy to follow and quite funny at times (just thinking about the logistics of bringing the AT-AT along on field trips!). Well done. Thank you.",5
16417,Well structured course. Accessible for everyone who has an interest in cryptography. Really good in repeating the key points.,5

45639,This is a very useful and really necessary subject that make me get other subjects or anything I will learn more effective and easier.,5
48646,"I really like to the content of the course, but the problem of it is that it does not really incorporate the legal skills one acquires from Law School and is thus somewhat of a false representation of the case law that is offered.",3

49872,"This is the first time that I've taken a course just for the fun and engagement it provides. For years I've tried to learn programming and have found the courses and books rather intimidating and/or boring. This course is fun, practical and certainly covers all the basics.

73358,very complete and detailed materials provided. good illustration.,5
80066,"Clear and engaging introduction, well spaced out to let the good stuff soak in.",4
43391,"One of the best courses I have taken so far. I didn't need to write many things down, because there were so many small quizzes that helped me remember the key points. It was very well presented and there were no fluff videos to waste time or bulk up the content. Everything made sense and all the steps are ones that I can and will add to my new study style.",5
81022,"A very organized and well guided course. However, the contents are fairly difficult for a pre-university students.",4
99748,This course had great tips and some I hadn't thought of. This will give you a different perspective on ideas of multitasking and how to manage multiple tasks concurrently.,5
10329,"Positive: Approach to the topics is solid, readings are very valuable.Negative: Some videos in week 3 and 4 have audio issues. Course should had a template with the course objectives, learning outcomes and grading scheme. 4 out of 6 quizzes didn't allow to see which questions were right or wrong. Social media resources such as a linkedin group for the specialization would add value. But the most negative aspect was not having the slides. A lot of the topics covered were presented very fast and not having the slides to review the materials made my experience in learning very frustrating. I note that also the course Critical Perspectives on Management had the same problems with the quizzes and also did not provide slides. what was somewhat frustrating also. Also, if IE is making an effort to become more relevant in this online space, it should allocate human resources to monitor and interact in the discussion forums. In my opinion there are a lot of opportunities to improve the student experience. What I found somewhat because being this a series of courses in marketing, a lot of these issues had to been fixed/addressed before the course started...Nonetheless my critics - which I expect to be considered as constructive critics, it is important to thank IE and Coursera for continuing providing online courses.I wish you luck.Ricardo J. Oliveira",3
46333,"This was an interesting introduction to the science behind learning, memorization, and countering procrastination.",5
92061,"Perfect course, as usual.",5
96394,strongly recommend!,5
6199,"The problems are interesting, the course is great. However, the problem sets in this programming challenge are often not so well-defined, which makes it really difficult to solve (especially the dataset problem). The solution of the problems usually turns out to be quite simple, but is not applicable to a large set of problems, only to the particular dataset that is given (and the characteristics of this dataset is not given; so I end up thinking about all possibilities that might occur for that dataset, which makes the problem more difficult).The examples given in the problem set are also not sufficient to describe the characteristics of the problem clearly.However, I really appreciate the whole courses, and I think it has been a great experience to go through the courses! Thank you very much!",3
103944,"The course was very well organized, but the main topics of the course were still covered. The lessons needed to be more structured and not so ad-hoc. The final assignment was peer reviewed, but the feedback (based on student feedback) was not very useful.",3

53676,Best online course I have ever taken to date. Thank you Andrew Ng for delivering such great lectures and assignments-- I learned a lot about Machine Learning because of you. I hope you make another course someday.,5
10895,"This course was a very helpful for filling in gaps in my knowledge between high level software development and details of processor architecture and instruction sets (MIPS mainly). I didnâ€™t have the exact prerequisites for this advanced course so it was hard work especially at the beginning (hadnâ€™t done the earlier architecture course recommended and am not an electrical engineer, but have trained and worked in software development and physical sciences). The concepts are not unduly difficult but the course is VERY detailed and the sheer volume of recommended reading somewhat overwhelming: I got by with buying a Kindle version of the Hennessy and Patterson text book (plus a few peeks into a digital logic book). I appreciated Prof Wentzlaffâ€™s insights: he was clearly teaching from experience.The course is however not really designed bottom-up for online teaching. The lectures are videos of actual Princeton lectures, with a few multiple choice questions hacked in. It helps to keep a copy of the slides when watching as when the camera pans out it is difficult to read the diagrams on the board.The course homework was quite difficult, even after the brief solutions were given. The mid-term and final tests exams were however well constructed and instructive and much clearer as to what was required. So all in all a real bargain for the cost of a text book!",4
1164,This is wonderful swathe through Greek history. I'm glad I was invited along.Thank you.,5
794,"This is not an easy course, but once you finish it, your academic writing skills are going to improve considerably, Best!",5
31015,"The course has been very interesting and useful; however, I would have liked that my homeworks were reviewed by both the teacher and the colleagues.",4
47393,"This course gives you the tools you will wish you had long ago. It will help you understand the way your brain works and work with it, not against it. You'll learn new way to study, use different thinking modes, and use sleep to solidify the material you're learning. The professor uses simple mnemonic's and a lot of visual aides which make it easy to understand and remember the concepts (which in and of itself is a lesson on how to absorb materiel).She's is very personable and cool, and for me personally, struggling to enter college at 26 for the first time, hearing her say she was my age when she started and is now an engineer was very inspiring!",5
73098,"Nice, brief intro to typography. Good, clear lecture content and interesting assignments. I feel like the ""by the book"" assignment should not be entirely peer graded.",4
62720,Nice course for practical knowledge of new marketing concepts / possibilities through the changing digital environment.,3
53288,This course is perfect and suitable for those who have interest in machine learning techniques and has begun or is beginning to learn about it. This course does not require much maths and prior knowledge and is highly recommended.,5
5299,"Very clear expectations, and the lectures were spaced out nicely to cover material while not being overwhelming. Additionally, the analogies used to convey the principles were clever and helpful!",5
48566,Really useful,5
1841,Very interesting course,4
1993,"I have zero business background and I found this course to be challenging enough that I learned something new, but it didn't take me that long to master the basics so I could starting talking about what I learned with my business-trained friends almost immediately.I did have to think carefully about the final assignment which was great for my learning. I also enjoyed marking other people's assignments and gaining new insights of the case from my fellow MOOC students.",5
103395,"Weekly quizzes instead of just the final (that actually counts for a grade) would be very helpful to me, but it was a great course and I learned a lot!",4
45065,I really enjoyed the course. Thanks Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski for presenting us with a lot of great insight into how we learn and the pitfalls we may encounter.,5

73256,This is a great course! I learned so many things related to social and cultural issues. Public Policy is beyond Washington DC and this course will help you to understand this in a much better way.Great program!!!,5
19978,"generally satisfied with the course content and its execution. Gives a brief, but very qualitative, overview on the issue. Sadly as a citizen of EU, some of the course materials are focused more on the US economy/energy systems, which for me would be much more interesting to see these information about EU. But it is logical, as it is provided by an US institution.Overall I only can recommend to any newcomers to the global energy business or who want to get a little bit deeper knowledge about the issue.",4
12698,Excellent course. Gives you a well oriented description of the steps required for metastasis and doing so it opens our view of places were treatments can be implemented. Thanks for sharing your knowledge..,5

24783,concise but great course. the teacher also uses some examples to explain. it really helps.,4
67409,I honestly thought this course was all over the place and too general. It also seemed to be full of self - congratulations about what UPENN has accomplished with its research. I wanted more depth in a more targeted approach to improving my life.,2

53020,Very good and interesting course although there was not much feedback and replies by the Unversity.,4
50579,"I absolutely loved every second of this course. Steve really has been a great tutor throughout the course, and really managed to kindle my interest in his field of work. The lectures are short and sweet and contain a lot more information than I would have even thought possible. I'd recomend this course to anyone who wants to learn a bit about what makes them think and act the way they do.",5
28419,Very interesting and helpful course. I hope than professor will make course about painting on a computer with teoretical background and practice.,5
38379,Good overview of the birth of Rock,4
52136,The teacher's voice on first lessons are so flat and plain that is very boring to listen them. I left the course,1
91306,I am very impressed with presentation and content. This course approaches the skills in a systematic way. It will be beneficial to all levels of users. I strongly recommend for nonnative English speakers.,5
381,Very light and practical course. Good for beginners but also nice to refresh some tips for intermediate users.,5
15476,Awesome course!,5
5041,"The course has fun illustrations and a high quality of production, but the lessons themselves don't dive very deep. Ideas are introduced but not considered in depth. One such example is variance. We get the equations but not much insight into what it is a measure of and it's value. Additionally, and this might just be me, but the experiments used to illustrate examples at times are difficult to understand.",3
51319,Really great introduction to HTML and CSS.,5
105296,The final course assignment was not defined precisely enough which led to varying interpretations among graders and reduces grades for all as a result.Otherwise a good intro course for the analytics specialization that focuses on the managerial aspects of data analytics and the communication of results.I wish that links to supplementary reading on the statistics used in the course would be provided.,4
15620,This course is beneficial to all those who struggle with character plot. I thoroughly enjoyed it.,3

69338,"This course was dynamic and amazing. I found myself returning to the interface after class was completed to see if there was a second class to continue progress. I felt depleted to find there is no other course to continue the learning in this area. Thank so much. I really got a great deal out of this course and pray I can revisit it to practice off an on, while I am taking other Coursera courses for TESOL.",5

12312,Very useful for me as an Engineer but a bit out of date,4
57517,"Such a nice course! A lot of algorithms, and they are so well explained and (what is the most important) it is demonstrated how they work. Besides that, share coursera is awesome with all of its lecture notes. These knowledges helped me to do my master thesis work. Thank you so much!",5
43418,The most efficient investment of time. Beyond any doubts. Just take it. You will never regret.,5
12803,Only fit for absolute morons and perfect ignorants. No content value whatsoever. I don't understand why Coursera allowed this one to happen to be on the Coursera website.,1
40485,"Excellent ..I always knew ABOUT the French Revolution - i.e it happened- but I never understood the FULL consequences. Thank you, Professor McPhee..",5
70526,"The course is insightful and intuitive. The professors have done a great job. If you are already a programmer in some other language, you might find some topics a bit primitive but the project that is at the end of the module should be a good exercise even for the experienced programmers. And, to recreate the entire project on your own would be a great exercise. It will also gear you up nicely for the next course in the specialization.",5
2190,"Very good, detailed course, I can recommend! Before that I knew nothing about SQL, now I have moved to higher level of analyst. Sometimes the instructions are not 100% clear, but it is minor problem.",4
80226,An excellent way through,5
95653,Excellent course not only in terms of content but also the instructor is very well spoken and knowledgeable on the subject. He also made it very entertaining and enjoyable; not just an academic exercise. Most definitely I will like to listen more courses by him on the subject.,5

99537,Excellent Course. the topics are well organized and the lectures are very clear.,5
19234,Really interesting...,5
48493,This is less of a course on a programming language and sounds more like a mindset for programming. Glad that I have enrolled for the specialization and looking forward to go through the whole journey :),5
1973,"Great course with lots of practical information regarding finding work actually using the material.More actual case studies and less portfolio theory would have made the course a 5/5. Too much portfolio theory for a class on business analytics: Most people taking this class will never desire to work or have the opportunity to work for an investment bank, so I found it a bit irrelevant.",4
6023,Still waiting for my assignment grades for weeks 1-3 despite having had many people mark these.,3
31048,Well structured course. Just to the point course with things that gets us started as quickly as possible.,5

86839,"The Teacher made me thirsty of more work. Especially in the last chapter, I was looking for more challenging work. The way the assignment was designed and the topics were taught made me think, the assignment for the last week was quite easier and I was expecting something more challenging. This proves the beauty of this class. I wish I have a trainer like this always with me, at least as long as I cannot go out and look for work myself.Thanks a million to Dr. Charles Severance. This is a very positive experience.",5

22080,This is the third or fourth time I've reviewed this course but it still keeps asking me to,4
94457,It is a good course for learning regression model implementation in R. You may need to have a basic understanding of popular regression models like linear & logistic as the course doesn't cover mathematical aspects in detail,4
82755,"A wonderful course, and a great introduction to both functional programming and Scala language. It's high time that we start paying attention to Functional Programming paradigm, and thanks to Scala we can now use it in the mainstream production grade development.I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is looking for a new (and likely better) way of thinking about programming.",5

84411,Must also include classes and lambda functions!,5
87716,"This was a short but very good introduction to APIs and Python's ability to retrieve data from the web.The load is quite low, so my suggestions to the teacher would be: make it harder! Include more examples and make both quizes and assignments harder in the same amount of time.",5

53479,Amazing course! Amazing Prof. Andrew Ng!,5
32873,This course delivers on what it promises- teach absolute beginners on HTML. the quizzes and case study will strengthen your understanding of the concepts with ease. Well worth the money and time.,5
78923,Thanks,5
71950,"Excellent overview of the music business. The course had a ""goldilocks"" quality to it...not too much information so as to overwhelm a beginner but just enough examples and facts to whet the appetite of those looking to dig deeper or become better prepared and more knowledgeable about their business as an artist!",5
38304,A great course - I thoroughly enjoyed it.,5
92376,"The lessons were simple, concise and although the assignments are simple, they are unexpectedly satisfying! Dr Chuck must have put a lot of time to come up with the code, draft the materials for this course and make it accessible enough to people without a database background! I especially like the last assignment! Thanks Dr Chuck!",5
7155,"Why there is no ""minus one"" star? Because one star is way to much for this course. Stay away!",1
57504,I really learnt a lot. Thanks for your patient teaching. And I appreciate having this opportunity to learn at one of the best universities. Hope I can have more such chances.,5

84945,It was very enjoyable to learn Python in this course. I have programming experience so it was easy but the way this course was taught compared to other online classes I have taken is exceptional. It was fun and instructional. Seeing video of other students around the world and the fun that Dr. Chuck convey throughout the class made it so enjoyable. Thank you very much to Dr Chuck and all his collaborators on this course. I look forward to one day to meet Dr Chuck and personally thank you for being who he is a very giving individual and inspiring many others to do the same.,5
1255,Good Questions and very good Test Cases.,5
20433,"Don Hornstein is a very engaging instructor in his lectures, which makes watching the videos a breeze. I wish there was more though for reading materials. I gave the course five stars because it does as it states, it is an very brief introduction into Environmental law. However, I feel there are things lacking that can be improved upon, like written work and more in depth study.Perhaps a specialization where the subjects are taught in courses of 4 weeks, where they go in more depth. Such as common law and nuisance, wildlife protection act, clean water act, and air pollution. Then finishing off with a capstone project. If a specialization was offered, I would sign up. I feel the missing requirement of coursework beyond the quizzes is detrimental to my retaining the information learned.",5
55056,"Great course, and my first experience with an MOOC. I learned a lot, and am already brainstorming ways to apply it.",4

111,2 thumbs up learned something that I have never learnt before.,5
99566,"This course teaches how to use spreadsheet to do some predictive modelings. Although no depth in math, but for me, some practical skills and functions are introduced.I just give 4 stars only because the overall content is still kinda simple. I though I could have learnt more with this price.",4
99613,"Decent introduction course however examples are very simple as well as the models that are constructed. I understand being an intro course the content needs to ease people into the subjects however, more realistic and real-life examples are necessary to take the material from this course and apply it.",3
35458,my first ever experience with coursera and this course made me to make a fabulous start.,5
79397,Good for personal development,5
71139,It was great and challenging course. Every software engineer should take this course to learn the fundamentals of functional programming and how to write concise code.,5
79199,Simple and clear explanations to solve problems.,3

16078,Very basic course,3
47488,"Great and simple-to-follow course. It teaches you very useful techniques to improve your learning and tackle procrastination, with day-to-day examples and metaphors. Even though part of the course is presented in a simple and intuitive language, some lectures will go deeper in psychological and neuro-scientific explanations to let you better understand how the brain works regarding learning. A must do course for every passionate learner who's willing to optimize his time and effort when approaching new concepts.",5

61585,Professor is not engaging at all. Presentation skills are poor.,1
105992,This course is much more informative than the previous two in my opinion. I liked the sample spreadsheets provided. I still however feel the price is a bit steep compared to other similar courses you can find online. The quizzes aren't that challenging and it may be nicer to expand the assignments to practice more.,3
91129,"The course was well structured, providing a wealth of information packaged in concise videos, alongside additional documents for further reading. CA was also designed in a manner that required a proper understanding of the source material and not memorisation.",5

75200,very good course lectures and interesting coursework,5
17939,"Hi, the prject was nice and at the end I learned some new things, but it didn't have people to provide any guide. In the videos it was said that personal from SwiftKey will be there as well as JHU teachers could provide some insights. It looked a bit like a phantom course",3
46725,"I like the material of the course, the interviews but I think it is pretty strict with the answer(s) the ask for in some of the first assessments.",3
29737,great course,5

63374,I want more)),5
5270,"I love the main lecture of the statistics. The Subject is fun. After couple lecture, my mind was very clear.But most of the time I'm working on the statistics software name R. I think it would be better if require R knowledge. If not, student like me will need more than weeks to get use to R. I don't mean learn another software is bad idea. I will always like to learn something new. That's why I go MOOC. What I mean is R and Basic Statistics should be separated. First R, than Basic Statistic. Or first Basic Statistic than R.I really enjoy the class. but the extra is a bit heavy for me.",1
40416,Very handy for if you are trying to get a job!,5

66536,Very intensive and interesting as usual of MoMA courses,5
44445,Really helpful in learning.,5
103557,"This is a course for students with little or no work experience. I've been in the industry for twenty years and found some good information, but the quizes aren't designed for experienced adult learners. Not being able to discuss with the professor why an answer is incorrect or even knowing exactly what about an answer makes it incorrect further distances the students from learning. Given that one essentially spends an extra work day each week on the course, I expected more value for my precious time. This week I decided the value isn't there. I might recommend the course for undergrad students but not for working adults.",1
40902,"Except for the last lecture on Jerusalem, I loved each and every lecture in the course. Also, the quizzes should have been a little longer, i.e. with more questions, at least 3-5 questions for each week.",5
9163,Great Course Instructor with lots of Humor... Dude makes calculus easy!!! Thumbs up to the production guys the music at the end and beginning of the course is really exciting... I LOVE THIS COURSE!!!,5
42678,"This course was brilliant on the whole! The videos and interviews were good, although it could have gone into more depth into how we use our brains to harness the concepts and our thinking to come up with solutions to unfamiliar situations. This has revolutionized the way I learn, and given me a fresh perspective into how the human brain works.",4
20249,Not too much material in addition to the Types of Conflict course but worth reading,4

15152,"It is a good course, however, I would have liked deeper knowledge in git",3
31491,"Amazing, I really enjoyed the first part of the course",5
87619,"Yet another excellent course... My prior reviews were so ravingly positive that I now feel compelled to offer a very minor area of potential improvement: Dr. Chuck might have considered going a bit deeper into Geojson API and perhaps even done a second API. Also there were some glitches in the Geojson assignment: My python Spyder was left frozen a couple times before I got things working.I understand that some students would have complained due to the length of Week 6, but if you requested the simple first assignment completion after the first 10 minutes of video lecture, you could have snuck in two concrete API assignments later on. Also, you could have had a Week 7 with the second API and alternate Web Access assignments. In sum, I was left wishing I had a bit more API experience.Nevertheless, I give this class 4.75 stars, which rounds up to the usual 5 stars. I've completed three of Dr. Chuck's classes and I'm on the fourth. Dr. Chuck is the incarnation of the super MOOC professor. Long live Dr. Chuck!",5
56681,Awesome course. I hope it's a career-,5
98465,"Course is good. However, some of the packages discussed in the examples, such as ggplot etc. should be discussed in more detail.",4

1328,"Great overview course. I have taken algorithms in college, and I am currently a software developer, but I have found this tremendously useful to review the material (especially good for interview prep!). I even gain a better understanding of concepts I thought I knew well already. The professor explains everything in a concise and thorough manner, the homeworks are well thought out, and the hints are helpful. The only improvement I could think of for the course would be to make the lecture sound a bit quieter during the few times the professor would cough -- the mic distortions can be a little annoying. Overall, highly recommend this course to anyone looking to learn basics of algorithms or review the material for interviews or general understanding.",5

65857,"Not being an historian on the Middle Ages, Magic in the Middle Ages seems like an accurate and well planned course. Week-4 and week-5 were the most interesting, with week-5 delving into the knitted relationship of magic in Islam, with roots and lineages directly connected to contemporary practices of ""magic"" (which is something I did not know and was very curious about regarding the context of political and religious tensions evolving throughout the middle east). I would have liked more activity-based and practical instructional units on how magic and rituals were conducted, especially information on healing, medicines, and alchemy. Geomancy was the only practical component with explicit details on how to cast figures, and it needed to incorporate how it was used with astrology in a practical way. A unit on Astrology and the Astrolabe was needed as well since the videos and literature often referred to astrology, and without a basic working and understanding of how an astrolabe was used to calculate a chart, the student is left hanging on having to figure way too much on their own (which becomes rife with problems and miscommunication). The quizzes and assignments are fun but often awkwardly worded which became confusing, and can easily be cheated on. Grading of assignments was a bit nebulous and put into question others abilities to accurately and fairly grade. People paying money for course content should be separated from students not paying because engaging, stimulating, and critical analysis as discourse cannot be maintained in fidelity. Of course, the credibility of ALL courses on Coursera are at stake because little to no universities and businesses accept the certificates as valid credentials for jobs or career ladder mobility. Ultimately, one is paying for a piece of paper that is not really valued or even usable at the very same institutes that put together the coursework; and that is a very lame proposition! The final kicker is that I needed to submit highly sensitive, personal identification just to get a PDF of the certificate--absolutely ridiculous, especially considering that the topic of interest for this course neither necessitates nor warrants such high-end secure methods.",4

The production quality of the videos is very professional and they interview experts in many different fields(history, literature, meteorology, biologists, etc.) to provide a very interdisciplinary view on the topic of the course. The quizzes aren't very challenging but they suggested plenty of supplemental material for those that want to learn more about the subject.",5
72153,Thorough course. You can definitely tell that it was designed by a teacher.,5
49396,"First Step Korean is a really good beginner course to start learning Korean. The lectures are structured in a clear manner that gives the learner ample examples to understand the usage of the language and allows the learner to practice along very naturally with Prof. Kang.Personally, when I learnt basic Korean through Korean TV shows and classes in a community club, it was hard for me to grasp the grammar as it was pretty confusing. This basic course allowed me to understand the usage of grammar, such as ì´, ê°€, ì€, ëŠ” and transforming basic form verbs.The lectures are delivered in a way that allows you to learn in a gradual manner and frequently review what you have learnt in previous lectures. The subtitles and notes make the lessons really easy to understand and follow.Through Coursera's online platform, the video lectures allows easy review of the lecture without having to physically sit through a class. I'm glad and grateful that First Step Korean is offered on Coursera and I hope there's a Second Step Korean in the near future for us to carry on with intermediate learning.",5

58250,Great course! The instructor walks you through all the learning process. You can take your time while watching the classes and it does not expect you to have a huge previous knowledge to understand what is going on. I really recommend the course to everybody that wants to get in touch with machine learning.,5
50908,"I really liked the course. It was too easy for my taste, but that's normal for an introduction, I guess. What I really appreciated: You can actually interact with the staff, and they seem to be willing to iteratively improve the course -- quite in line with the principles of Agile Software Development :-)",5

82495,"The course lectures are even better than PGM I, as it appears that Professor Koller has recorded some material recently that helps fill in small holes from the previously recorded lectures. Hopefully she'll have time to clean up PGM I in the near future for future students.This course is another tour-de-force for debugging, though it definitely made me a better programmer (I'm intermediate). I wish that the Discussion Boards were more active, and it's a shame that the Mentors were Missing In Action. On the one hand, the programming instructions were sometimes a bit vague, which made the assignments less like assignments are more like research projects. For these 2 reasons, the course is 4-star rather than 5-star.Still, it's a lot better than trying to learn this out of the book by oneself. Some say enrollment has dropped off since they began charging for getting access to Quizzes and Programming Assignments. Or it may be attrition, as these are pretty challenging (and well taught) courses. I'm very happy to support this course financially, as it's loads cheaper than what I'd be paying if I were back at Stanford.Like PGM I, I strongly recommend doing the Honors Programming Assignments, as it's really the way to learn the material well.",4

7207,The course gives an extensive overview of the topic. I have particularly appreciated the hands on section.My recommendation to all the students is to not overlook the hands on and create some personal notes and code archive to quickly review those topics.Some particular good learning for myself: lucene. I have used lucene at work both directly and wrapped within elastic search: in both cases I was not going deep in understanding the data model behind lucene and concepts like similarity. You can leave like that in the vast majority of the current jobs where lucene is a third party system invoked upon needs but understanding the model behind was simply much more easy than I expected.,5

25591,"While I really liked the first course I have massive problems with this course. The first 2 assignments, a high concept document and a story bible were doable.But a full GDD and a prototype on week 3 and 4? These aren't part-time tasks for a few days, these are full-time tasks for at least a full month each to do them properly from scratch. These assignments are so unrealistically hard that they demotivate. And I'm saying that as someone who already had quite some ideas for one game and even started experimental programming. For people that are taking this specialization without a focus on game design and/or without ideas... this course is going to be hell to finish in time.",2
16580,"A very informative course in the sense that though its very basic but its the first time I got everything in a structured way. I am already a Infosec professional however my domain is not mobility. So mobility with security and its use business development is a phenomenal task. Hence, I guess its a very good course for this specialisation. I am not giving 5 stars as there is always scope for improvement. However, it may be taken as a five star course.Thanks to all the people who designed the course.",4

9974,"An excellent course that is a great opportunity for anyone interested in bioinformatics, no previous experience is necessary but either a biological, mathematical or computing background will give you advantages in certain areas. Being a biologist I struggled at first and many of you may do the same but stick with it, work hard on it and you will be rewarded and it is incredibly satisfying.Due to the practical coding nature of the course, each week can take up a lot of you time. Best if you have a few weeks free (e.g. a graduate student like me) so you can spend a few whole days of it but could be done before/after work if you are motivated and plug away at it each day - just something to keep in mind though, don't expect a light easy 1 hour a week course, it is intensive but in a good way. It can get frustrating, you will want to give up time and time again....but stick at it and you will have a shiny new Coursera certificate and a wealth of programming knowledge under your belt once you finish!A massive two thumbs up for this course, one of the best ones out there that gives you real worthwhile skills that employers and academia want. Thanks to all the course staff for a great experience!",5
85720,The first three weeks are totally trivial. I hardly doubt that anyone learns something except how certain practices are called. (Maybe good for school students.) Week 4 is better. I recommend the lecturer to improve the previous weeks and to redistribute some of the contents of week four. Some real-world examples which point out typical mistakes or give useful hints would be welcome in the first three weeks as well.,1
884,"After finishing week 1, I have decided to stick with Duke university's Medical neuroscience which is starting up again. I also highly recommend ""Understanding the Brain The Neurobiology of Everyday Life"" which I believe was taught by the University of Chicago. I found them to be far more engaging the viewer and the format to be much easier to follow. I found it visually disturbing and also have to keep pausing to read the slide before it switches.It's too bad because I was really looking forward to this course. It also seemed she had trouble pronouncing many of the words and I do not want to learn how to pronounce many of them incorrectly also many of the slides did not have an English translation on them.",1

Keep concentrated on a subject, while taking good rest can not be overestimated. Wish those who have taken this course can learn from it.",4

The only feedback i would like to give is regarding the faculty lack of interaction in the discussion forums. I feel they did not answer some of the questions sent to them in the specified forums and this lack of interactions diminishes the impact of the course. The course is still great, so i did not remove one star because of this, as i want to think the faculty will address the point above in future courses.",5
19673,"The exercises are not very interesting. The exercises initially focusses on identifying a leader who we have worked with but It should also focus on how am I as a leader, what is my level of emotional intelligence, how do I scale up basis some test etc. I lost interest in the course because it was more about seeing some one else as a leader than myself.There is a lot of research into the course yet it is too theoretical & not put in precise & interesting manner. The module needs to be shorter.",2

78339,"Nice course! It is definitely a beginner's course, and my only complaint is that in order to be able to take the capstone course we will have to pay for and be certified for this course. I really think there should be an option for people who aren't absolute beginners to enter the track at a later point and still be able to get the full cert and/or do the capstone. After all, this track is geared toward using Python for analysis and data science, which is hardly a topic that is for absolute beginners.For what it is, though, namely a very beginning level course to teach the concepts of programming with Python, it's very well executed.",4

32717,The course is very interesting and educational especially for someone from the developing world like me.,5
10030,Too much time required. The first Quiz had almost nothing covered in the video lectures. I saved all transcripts and was unable to answer the questions. The Sim's... I have never seen anything like that and again - it most certainly wasn't covered in the lectures. Disappointed in this course. It took 3 hours for each segment of the first week... not 3 to 4 as was stated. Leaving this course.,2

The review questions and programming exercises are very good for enhancing understanding of the concepts.I understand that in order for this course to be accessible to people with all backgrounds some of the deeper stuff are not covered such as derivations to some of the math formulas. This is OK. However, for people with a stronger math background like me is it possible to add some optional videos for those deeper stuff? The optional video on multi-variable Gaussian distribution is a great. There can be more stuff similar to that.",5

The course perfectly fits my needs.This introductory course provides the fundamental principles and general design tricks in condensed and very clear form.Major ideas are defined in several best practices supported by relevant examples and engaging exercises.I like the idea to deliver graphical design, writing, and presentation courses together with references between related topics. Such holistic approach gives us the better view on real ""design of everything.""Great job David!Thank you",5

55371,"Fairly good videos explaining the material, probably worth 4 starts. However, the written support material should be improved. IMHO the video should supplement the written material, i.e. it should be possible to learn the material only by reading. This is not the case, so frequent pausing of videos and making lots of notes is needed if one wants to commit this course to long-term memory.",2

102355,"One of my ALL-TIME favourite courses on Coursera. I reaped so much joy of this course. As a baby meditator, I was first captured by the interest to see the parallels between mindfulness meditation and evolutionary psychology, and I'm very happy to have seen the latest scientific findings that corroborate some of the teachings of the Buddha. Mr. Robert Wright - the professor - is smart, authentic and fun. His lectures are well-crafted and well-sequenced. I especially enjoyed going through most of the supplemental course materials which included book readings and video interviews. These were thoughtfully selected to back up Prof. Wright's hypothesis and suppositions, and the interviews were conducted by himself with various scholars both in the scientific and Buddhist realms. I totally enjoyed the office hour videos which were useful and fun. I'm saving all of the course materials- that's how good it was. Thank you, Mr. Wright. May you be happy, peaceful and liberated! :-)",5

The assignments are exceptionally challenging given that the instructors offer now actual instruction on how to perform them. Two and a half days into the course not a single moderator has answered a question in the forums and I can't find a way to contact Coursera about this problem.I am very disappointed. I was planning on taking additional courses through the Coursera platform, but now I am reconsidering.",1

3905,Some essential concepts are covered in this course which help understand the basis of IOT.,5
105436,"For an undergraduate course it's good - my only comment is on delivery - quotations given verbally might have been better if shown on screen to drive them home.I hope the professor will do a military history course that analyzes war more particularly now that we have the broad strokes. My interest is piqued from this course and I want to know more about specific wars/battles. I am also interested in war prior to 1500, esp. ancient civilizations.",3

5039,"I had a really great time with this course. A lot of work went into it, from the presentation to the content. Really well done. It was quite challenging.

103723,although the teacher must be using android phone but it does not influence its a nice lecture,4
85736,I would have like it if they could provide free graded assessment to non-certificate students; and make option for certification,3
104276,I am all for short videos but here it is a little bit too short... Tehchnically there is about 1h of videos for the 4 weeks of this course and no real documentations to review.Hence you get few pointers on how to design game wold for video games and really case studies in my opinion... A full review of one or two games would have been a great addition.,3

51004,so nice course thnx all of u,5
72553,"There are two frustrations with this iteration of the series. One: the quiz questions are often opaquely worded. Instead of being tested on the material just learned, it seemed like the objective was to learn to decode test questions.2 and the most glaring omission, was that when students are asked to provide functions, only some are provided with a follow up test to ensure the function is working properly. If the output is syntactically correct but provides incorrect output then you're moving forward blindly after that. Then add the quiz questions from problem One above, and you're just wasting your time after that and building up frustration. Validating your code as you move along seems like a pretty rudimentary process to impart to students and when the teachers don't practice it themselves, there are bound to be problems.I like the intent of the course, and considering my outsider background to computer science, the mathematics etc, I did learn a fair bit. Not enough to justify the increasing frustration I was feeling toward the end of this course. I have no intention of taking any more at this point, not from these authors.",2
6716,Excellent course. Jonathan is a great pianist and a great instructor.,5

67614,It was hard to learn from the materials that we have to buy. Please understand that not everyone who sign up for the course can afford to buy the books on amazon. Lack of those books are showing effects on the way we attempt the assignments. It would be great if download links or online study links are provided in the readings section for all the necessary books instead of only a few.,4
20747,Excellent revision course for those who would have previously been introduced to Epidemiology and great for those who are now being introduced to the field.Reviewing of the added reading materials is recommended for heightened comprehension.,5

44502,This course presents a very nice overview of how the mind works in relation to learning and why some studying techniques are more effective than others as a consequence.The content can feel a little bit shallow at times but is presented in a very engaging way and with lots of pointers for people who want to deepen the knowledge of a particular aspect.All in all I highly recommend this course!,5

89153,Excellent introduction to Responsive Web Design,5
72557,"I'll definitely keep learning the next course.Some people criticized about graphlab (I thought they should offer 2 versions like RStudio instead a limit-free one. Although I feel comfortable when using graphlab, I'll still use scikit-learn after finishing all courses because it is free and I just use for personally.) but you can use scikit-learn to pass this course (although you have to spend more time) , so this is not a sufficient reason to not giving 5 stars for me.Great course.",5

66068,Really excellent. Thank you for outstanding lectures :-),5
74014,Wonderful course. Dr. Severance simplifies the daunting world of coding (it's helpful though that python is an easier language to take--a gateway CS language in my opinion) for everyone. Seriously. I think of writing code now like writing English essays (which I enjoy; I'm sure very few share my feeling). Wished it'd update to python3.5 though.,4
12434,The lectures were very structured and informative. The quizes were challenging. The final week was demanding and fleshed out concepts,5

2969,Its tough to get your head around the various concepts but as Dr. Fowler and the reading material say - Don't be afraid and use lots of paper. I'm 41and a non-engineering graduate. I completed this course so that I may take additional science and engineering related courses on-line.,5
10617,too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment,1

68338,"This is one hell of a courseThis is basically a good introduction to each and every basic ML technique, what makes this distinct from the other courses is that, you really get your hands dirty with writing code on Python, which is really an industry relevant language for Data Sciences and MLThe theory is also, taken in detail and the assignments are cleverly designed, this course was a joy to take. Initially, I thought that I would complete this course in a span of 6 weeks, which is actually prescribed. But, the fluidity of the course content was so great, ended up completing the course within a weekDefinitely, taking the advanced courses",5
40305,"I like the content of the course.However, there are some remarks I want to share.For one of the asssignments I have to create an accout on Soundcloud. I never used it before and do not understand why I should leave somewhere my personal data if I do not plan to use this service in the future. I assume it as direct manipulation and do not like it at all.",3
102884,Perfect!,5
52452,"The course has been very structured, very focused yet has all the depth of a very complex problem. Bravo!",5
97039,Thank You for the course.,4
10711,I have studied this course as part of the Executive Data Science Specialization. I think this set of four courses meet my objectives by providing a very nice overview on the key points of data science projects. They are good to give a flavor on data science and data science projects helping decide if you want to search for more in depth knowledge.,4
45932,"It is a quite good course let me understand my brains scientifically, and now I don't doubt I'm not smart enough. I know what learning is, and how to control it. It's really helpful.",5
32439,"Great course! I would like to thank the teachers for their awesome work in this course, itÂ´s been a pleasure choosing Epidemics - the Dynamics of Infectious Diseases, so much that I will do my best to translate the course for the spanish speakers. Again, please continue teaching!",5
63587,An awesome and must take course for the aurduino.,5
70543,"A great practical overview of java as a programming language. I have always learnt it in bits and pieces, so it was nice to be introduced various features of the language as well as objected oriented programming to address the growing complexity of a project.",4
30602,"Great class. Some slides show awful colors. I think that could be improved. Also professional transition betwixt slides could give the course a more ""polished"" look.",4
88726,"Capstone was great, although I would have learnt stuff better if there was a small battle from the deadlines and the curriculum in particular. This was a fun specialization and am looking forward to graduate soon! Thanks Dr. Chuck :)Cheers!",3
76398,"Great course, incredible teacher. I recommend this to anyone and everyone who does not know how to code and wants to start somewhere.",5
84488,Excellent course for a beginner!!,5
82552,"Excellent professional development course for me to hone my English skills. Superb video, quizzes and exercises. Much better than learning in a workshop or using a workbook. Thank you! Top notch program.",5
49268,Highly user-friendly and intuitive. Easily one of the best MOOCs I've come across.Well done! as Ms. Seung Hae Kang herself would put it.P.S.:Wish there was a sequel to it.,5

52070,Interesting and super simplified material! Thanks to the instructor.,5
4767,i've learned tons of new things. i would like to have more materials on the subject. could the staff attach some recommended readings? other courses? than you for making this course :),5
76941,"I'm sure this is a fantastic introduction for those with no prior programming experience, but as someone with even just a little bit of prior scripting experience, I found it extremely slow-paced. Rather than suffer through the lectures, I did DataCamp's Intro. to Python and then did all the quizzes & assignments for this class as extra practice.",3
38733,The last question was kind of weird to have it say fill out the table but then give an open textbox.,5
38761,This is the best course I have ever attended! Many-many thanks to mr. Picker for his great antitrust perspective and an ability to easily explain very complicated issues! Looking forward to your new courses involving antitrust and again thanks and best wishes!,5

56831,"Could be more mathematical in places, but a nice overview of machine learning.",4
82447,"Excellent course. Fast paced, and the final project is a doozy, but well worth the effort. Dr. Yee-King is a fantastic instructor and does a great job of walking you through the material while encouraging the students to pursue further research on their own to more fully understand the nuances of the course subject. The code examples provided are very helpful, with easy to understand comments to help guide the student through the code. I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for the rest of the courses in the specialization!",5
8697,"Great course involving ""experiential"" learning!",5
55751,Excellent for fresher,5
41108,"Short and easy-to-take, the courses teaches some of the essential elements of game design.",5

13060,"I had no time to actually do the course material properly (due to real-life work) but I loved following what I could and eventually will take the course properly (next year). There is a lot of material covered and can be challenging for someone with little knowledge of music theory, but with some extra baxkground reading (and some wikipedia articles) one can catch up quickly. Highly recommended.",5
59152,"Great course, learning lots of new things although it assumes a level of mathematics much (much!) more elementary than mine, making some sections a little slow.",5
61256,"This course is awesome, I think all developer should take a look at this!",5
29803,"Much better than the first course in the specialization.Too many dependencies on non-standard data formats, like MS Word.",3
33486,"Good lecturer and presentation. Some additional contents and details would be good, but this was a good start into HTML5",4
79332,I think it was very informative,4
27418,"The topics that were explained very lucidly and clearly. The real-world examples helped develop an intuitive understanding of the course material. However, I think more topics could be covered in an additional few weeks.",4
5753,Pretty good course and refresher. Enjoyed working through the problems.,5
79855,"There are too many poured notions without practical explanations or case studies. Slides are read bullet point after bullet point without added value. The course is not compelling in any way. Too many references to a book said to be not compulsory.In the final exam right answers are not given.The course gives you just a smattering of the subject, nothing that you can apply with confidence on the job.",2
5374,"This course is bad!I had come upto week 4. While Chris Impey is knowledgeable and good, the course structure is very poor and leaves a lot to be desired. I would venture to make some suggestions:a. Restrict each video to a max of 7 minutes. More than that makes one sleepy.b. Reduce the number of videos in each module to a max of say 6.c. Instead of having Chris expound it like an audio reading, please include some slides, pictures,tables so that the matter to be learnt becomes self evident and Chris doesn't have to speak so much. A good example is the Coursera ""The Global Financial Crisis"", which I am also doing currently.d. If you feel all the material in this course has to be studied, then to achieve the objectives in (a) and (b) above, divide this course into two parts, Astronomy: Exploring Time and Space - part I & II.e. The written assignments are very simple and do not require any mental resources other than memory. Can you make the questions more challenging? For example, in Telescopes (Assignment 2), can you not ask a question like ""In addition to Atacama, Chile, using Google earth, which other parts of the globe may be suitable for installation of ground based telescopes?"" or ""To obviate the blurring effect of the atmosphere, discuss the possibility of high altitude balloon based telescopes?"" or ""What do you feel about the fact that since today's mobile phones have high computing ability, their components can be used to make a low-cost space based interferometric telescopes?""Kudos to Chris and his team! On the whole, knowledge wise, this is a good course.",1
50399,"It was an intersting, a useful course!",5

34943,"Exceptional. The information is relevant, the topics presented well and the additional reference articles interesting.I suppose I should have taken the time to retake the tests to get 100% but who has time?Thank you!",5
106845,Very simplistic in places and preaches their style as if it is the only way sometimes too. However it's a good grounding in the basics and there are some useful exercises.,4
2292,The course is useful but I hoped that it would cover the area of treatment better than that.,5
106478,Great explanation and exercises. They really know the difficulties of ESL students. I truly loved this course and recommend.,5

44779,"Read Dr. Oakley;s book ""A Mind for Numbers."" Tooks this course's quizzes to test my recall on the book's material. Passed without viewing any of the lectures. Well worth it.",4
103399,Very thoughtful to not exclude me even when I did not hand in homework on time:),5
60530,"ItÂ´s not just Al and the TAs; it seems that everyone gets pulled in by the energy. There is a sense that all are welcome to share their thoughts, their reactions...itÂ´s beyond a course, itÂ´s a connection to others throughout the world who share a passion for poetry. Shine On!",5
104293,Prof. Hicks delivered one of my favourite Coursera courses. The course was both challenging and very relevant. It had the perfect balance of formal theory and roll-up your sleeves practical assignment.,5
43200,Very interesting and helpful.,5
69437,I think with more listen exercises this course will be better and the length of the videos too short.,2
42263,"The course are fantastic but 3 month HARD WORKING to earn a ""cheap"" certificate that looks false :( I cannot present it to my company",1

68732,Useful course. Covered good amount of usecases for Machine learning concepts with handson experience.,4
95748,"I enjoyed the lecture of Ms. Gerber. She has a very clear-cut way of explanation that truly draws me in. However, some of the concept in this lecture is taught without complete examples, so often time I find myself a little puzzled doing the assignment. Also, I would appreciate more chance to do more assignments to fully master the topic, though I understand the limit of a MOOC. Nevertheless, nice course!",4
103250,Curriculum an awesome rich topic,5
83189,"The course was very eye opening and interesting providing a different perspective into Indian society than the one I was exposed to from living in the West. I have gained a sound grasp into India as a country, how history has shaped modern day India, India's influence in the modern world, the sheer diversity of India. I've ultimately expanded on my way of thinking to accommodate new views in terms of spirituality and philosophy . Easily on of my favorite courses I have undertaken I thoroughly enjoyed the set readings and the quizzes and set work were all highly relevant requiring me to effectively apply theory and also allowed for creativity which I thoroughly enjoyed.",5
103093,"Very Interesting course! Learnt a lot. But, Please can i suggest that the test part should be left open so as to effectively finish the course. Then people can choose to upgrade to receive certificate at the end of the course session.Thank you.",5

38619,A great course which covers a lot of practical java!,5
6193,"This was a really good course, you'll learn, by example, theory and practice, why, how and when to use these Android App Components. Reading the entire code of each assignment is recommended, otherwise you may not fully understand why your code works, also, you may learn additional things by doing it.",5
12611,"Very nice course. It was very informative. Even though I did it in Audit mode, I am going to recommend my PhD students to do the course for improving themselves as physicists and computer science by knowing what actually goes behind the scene mathematically. I will recommend the course for all students of electronics (with strong desire to understand the mathematical basis) in general.",5
64152,"The professor was very pleasant to listen to. The pacing was overall good, though the last few lessons have quite a bit of information packed in. My only real complaint was that I was hoping for more explicitly direct links to be made to modern events. Still, very enjoyable class.",4

106322,assume class... You explore a lot of dinosaurs. Including many weird newly discovered ones. Plus you explore the variety what characterizes different types of birds.,5
9398,"very good considering the amount of information conveyed in the short amount of time. A few of the tests were slightly glitchy in the acceptable range of correct answers (in terms of rounding answers) and would only accept things like 17*sqrt(15426) as the answer, even if an equivalent value down to the 6th decimal place was give instead.",4

32283,"Interesting topic, with useful case-studies, removed a star because it feels too much like the speakers are reading their text, with frequent errors in the words / corrections / hesitations = doesn't feel natural enough. Most probably due to the danish-english language effort...",4
94075,"More like a 3.5 to 4? Close to 4. The main problem for me with this course was the assignment. I found it a bit unclear. The instructions are clear, but the way to go about completing the assignment was not. The last assignment we had in Course 3 was very specific and even had a video specifically on how to complete the assignment and why each step was important. We were given an example as to how to perfectly complete the assignment to extract the maximum knowledge from the course. In this course, that aspect was a bit lacking",3
96518,Mr Muppala is an amazing teacher and this course delivers the information you need on a need-to-know basis.,5

21950,A reasonable course. Could use a little more focus on dynamically creating a codebook.,4
52575,"I feel robbed. I did not get any feedback on my work. Only a classmate gave their ok ""yes, there is something written"".I did not follow the course to get a ""certificate"" but to learn and to revceive feedback. If you don't have a special purpose for the certificate - don't pay a cent for this.",1
72515,"It is really a lovely course! One point, among many others, that really amazed me is the geometric explanation of ridge and lasso! For me, I think the course would be better if the content can be more mathematically challenging but it is only a suggestion and the course is already quite perfect.",5
59365,Very fun and really teaches you how to implement so many different things very well. Didn't think I would learn this much,5
96231,"wonderful course well structured learning material .Any one interested in web Development must do this course.Thank you ,Sir for teaching and providing us such a informative course .",5
21996,Sometimes is hard to follow,3
26724,The course is nicely paced. I was able to go through all the videos and assignments within a day or two.Prof. Yaakov Chaikin is very skilled and makes his videos fun to watch. It is amusing as well and educational. Really liked the videos about the Restaurant Visit and how to talk to a customer and what to expect and how to deal with issues in the process.,5
26979,The instructor is great and I had fun watching Yaakov. I've also learnt a lot of stuff. I wish course would be a bit longer and contained a bit more challenging assignments. Especially those ones which are in the middle of week.,4
39273,"This course means well, but with very little critical thinking required, it ultimately communicates good intentions over solid content.",2
19501,gives full understanding of digital image and video processing,5
16603,This is a an important topic and more scientists (and students in the sciences) should learn about this but the quizzes are not great as a learning aid and my motivation is running through lows.,3
42869,"This course was designed near to perfection . Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr Sejnowski did a wonderful job.I liked the optional interviews a lot and learned from the insights of special achievers in their field.I liked the idea of writing essays on our plan of using this knowledge for our own and for teaching others what we have learned , fascinating and rewarding.",5
28295,"Great course, awesome professor! The course is great for all, even people who currently work in graphic design. I especially recommend this course for those of us who either have no formal training/education or those of us who have been in the business so long that a refresher course just adds value to what we already accomplish on a daily basis.",5
66087,"Thoroughly enjoyable. Easy to follow. I especially liked the question and answer sessions with the two students. Thanks Dr. Shapiro, for an excellent course.",5
80386,It is good and very important course,5
51873,Absolutely outstanding course rich with the materials and fun.A wonderful combination!,5
88008,"I thoroughly enjoyed the course learning a lot in a sort of retired auditor role. 4.8 instead of 5 stars only because in covering such a broad topic it often felt like a catalog of successive eras and life forms without delving into the mechanisms of evolution. e.g., insects and flowering plants are wildly successful and diverse, but I wanted to explore what it is about their morphology, reproduction and codependent relationship that made this so. Next course!Thank you all for a fascinating look into soooo many things !! :)Stephen",5
74617,Great course!,5
1683,Very interesting and explained common language. Looking forward for the next modules.,4
99538,"This is the kind of Angular course i was looking for,every other course i enrolled in,i found that they aren't really explaining what is going on under the hood, this course is certainly doing that which helped me understand important concepts to deepen my understanding.

55570,"In my opinion, Andrew Ng excels in teaching this course. He is able to keep you interested on the course by letting you know what are the most important things you need to carry on from each session. The content of the course is really good, videos, transcripts, slides, etc. Actually, several sites now suggest taking this course before moving into a more deep level of M.L.",5
73739,Inspiring course.,5
15087,Very light & not really consistent with the heavy workload of subsequent courses. Felt it could have been much much stronger explaining GitHub- which shows up as a problem in latter courses strongly suggesting that toolbox does not effectively cover GitHub for newbies,3
6686,Absolutely loved this course! Jonathan is amazing and he has inspired me so very much. I can hardly wait for his next series.,5
84766,"well explained, easy to understand and being presented clearly and interestingly .I really loved to participate in this course!",5

59394,the teacher is so cool,5
84519,It's Very suitable for beginners.And it's a Very good introductory course.,5
17638,some of the content and videos were too wordy and had more theory v/s examples.,4
28608,"Inedited subject, funny presented, interesting \and welcome concepts. Congratulations to the coursemakers!",5
41634,"At the beginning is quiet simple.. But if you miss something, and I'll be honest, in the forum you don't get so much help, you'll need to wait to the Instructor to reply you because he is the only who can put the ""answer"" or at least, the help you need.Aside this... This course is great! it teaches you every thing you need to know (at least the basics) for start programming in C#",4
5806,I like the assignments provided in the course,5
72991,"I've always wanted to learn typography but learning on it's own without any practice is really boring. The assignments are really good in applying what I have learnt, making the learning really enjoyable. The course teacher is super zen and loving his style of teaching.

72014,"Really loved the structure of the course.John kellog's lectures are even though they are a bit boring in the initial stages, they are very important and they create an life long impact on you if you try to focus.I love the way how berklee professors just carry the whole course just sitting with a black background.It needs great skills and experience to have such confidence in presenting a lecture like that..I'm always thankful to coursera for providing this educational courses. Coursera and Berklee college of music for life!",4
67617,This is a really nice course! I am fortunate to be part of it!,4

18694,"Not to much of interesting, but interesting",3
17991,Great course for beginners without experience in Python programming,5
92449,"This class was really difficult. The course material did not cover what we needed for the weekly quizzes (particularly in Week 3 & 4) and the final exam was immensely difficult. Additionally, the written instructions for the final exam did not even cover some of the questions that needed to be answered i.e. repeats or questions about particular reading frames when analyzing the ORFs. I had to do a lot of self teaching using random resources and I simply didn't have the bandwidth to dig around as much as was needed in order to do well in the class.",2
99969,"Great Lector, Easy to understand and implement material. But the course is too short.",4
95566,Very useful! I wish I had done this course before the beginning of the academi,5

15153,Very nice course gives insight to the basic tools useful / required for being a data scientist.,5
64538,"The course covered a huge amount of material but was presented in a clear concise way. I liked the way it pulled together so many different ideas and referred to places all over the world, giving the big picture as well as a fair amount of illustrative detail. The presenter was clear and concise in his delivery and paced it so the student could follow quite complicated material easily. I would have like to have the results of the quizzes before deciding whether to purchase",5
30695,"Very good course, I learned a lot about Grammar and Punctuation. A very friendly teacher. ItÂ´s a fast way to improve our writing.",5
88423,It is too simple and baic,3
1268,This review is based on the last three courses that I have undertaken in the Data Structure and Algorithms Specialization.While running our tests the output does provide the time and memory used for running our algorithms. I think it would also be instructive to see the running time of the best implementation in the particular language and the best time achieved ever by a student in such a course. It would provide us with an additional motivation to think about better and efficient implementations.Note: I do understand that running times might not always be an exact reflection of the actual time the algorithm takes.,5
87954,"I love this course very much, thank you. I wish an Arabic subtitle for they have poor English, and that's my mail if you want any help in ( promoting the course when you translate it into Arabic Language ) - heshammoh80@gmail.com -",5

105930,Learning chapter after chapter ! The videos are amazing and the quality of data and they way it is exposed is really good !,5
102529,"Professor Wright is very engaging and knowledgeable! He breaks down Buddhism in an intellectual manner that does not demean the spirituality of it, but also does not adhere to it. This makes the course both educational and easy to digest, for anyone with an aversion to spiritual matters (which you will learn in this course may be a source of suffering...). I am only on the 2nd week of lessons and can't wait to see this through to the end! In an unattached appreciative manner of course... haha. Thanks to everyone that put forth the effort to design and share this course!",5
44154,"The course was vary enjoyable and extremely practical. Every idea presented is very easily applicable and very valuable to any active learner. Moreover, the course itself is organised to be studied very effectively, and facilitates high retention of the material. Additionally, optional reading allows for a broader perspective and deepened exploration of the material.",5
89287,"Stuff is explained thoroughly, all documents are provided, teaching staff answers the questions in discussions.I've learnt a lot! Thanks to teachers!",5

69474,"Very good course for the beginners, who knows absolutely nothing about chinese",5
281,Great course!,5
99877,This is a short but inspiring course. It raises only a few key points but they are sufficient enough to shock you and encourage you to review your time management and goal setting.,5
103549,"Very clear and organized, I will certainly make use of what I learned when writing programs or designing software.",4
16754,Very useful this course. Thanks,5
105165,"There are a lot of kinks to be worked out in this course. The teaching aspect of the Craft of Writing is in the four previous courses, this one is basically write a story, get reviews.",2
74879,The exercises are confusing.,3
74203,"Thank you Dr Chunk, it's a definite course for Everybody. Your ability to put complex knowledge in easy to understand manner is simply amazing. Learned a great deal from you.

54181,Please add the random forest algorithm.,4
48774,"What can I say? Great course! I love professor Leigh, she speaks with passion and energy I like. The idea of assignments and quick quizzes helped to review learned knowledge. I can't wait to accomplish High Performance Collaboration and seek any other course of professor Leigh Thompson. Thank You.",5
40192,"The lectures were great. While some people complained that ""the instructor is reading off something else"" that never seemed to be a problem. Mr. Klemmer did a good job of making the lectures friendly and understandable. The best part of the course was the assignments. I loved how I actually had to go to people and interview them, draw storyboards of ideas I have and heuristically evaluate sites. The assignments made sure I was actually engaged in doing them. One thing I would suggest is to try different motifs for different sessions. It seems that students always work with a ""transportation problem"" in this course. That can be mixed up from time to time I think to give the students a more diversified experience of Human Centered Design.",5

78069,Can have more rigorous assignments. Right now the code snippets are already provided. Maybe keep some optional tough assignments to cater to all levels of programming abilities :),4
71824,"A simple and useful course on logistics in the context of supply chain management that helps even learners who have no previous experience to learn these topics which are of great importance in the modern world. Assignments with a practical orientation, good quality of audio and video and a great instructor are other points worth mentioning.",5
77635,"This is the best introduction to python that I've seen. I've completed Codecademy's python courses and attempted to learn from various webpages and books, but it wasn't until this course that I finally understood how python works. Thanks, Dr. Chuck!",5
75963,"Hello, I am glad that I am getting this course from one of the (Best) Author of Python Book. I am really happy with the contents & teaching style that made me so confident about coding in Python. Contents are helpful, discussion forum clarifies many doubts & the deep understanding of each module in this course make it a perfect choice for anyone to who even does not know 'A' of Python's Alphabet or of any coding language can start & learn to code. Good initiative by Author & Mentor. Please provide many such courses in near future so that we can learn best from Top University which is anyway not possible for students like us with financial problems! We learn many things from home & from Greatest University like in this case University of Michigan! Thanks for all work for making this course available online.",5

53185,A new and fast way of designing materials. Great course!,5
25771,"This course was amazing. I learnt a ton about about Unity and making games. I can give you a long review, but in short, it is challenging to understand, and there are slight loopholes which are hard to figure out sometimes. It was slightly disappointing that the course does not go into coding specifically, like the official tutorials do, but the official tutorials rush learning - these are much better. And when you see those official tutorials, you will see why you don't do much of your own coding - C# is not the easiest language.So, what does that mean? It means that this course is very much worth it for beginners. It is relatively easy to understand, but expect to do a lot of work!",5
18662,Week 4 was a big leap from week 3. Difficult with less time to complete the project. But course was good . I think course could be extended by adding 2 more weeks so that more practice sessions could be given to students.,4
90219,Interesting course! Thank you for the instructors. I will definitely try some other courses by these authors and University of Michigan.,5
34261,The knowledge in this course is really connected and applicable to not-only the everyday situations in in our businesses but also in general everyday lives.It has very useful and practical information to seek.,5
28296,interesting and fun course!,5

3061,"I love the instructor, she knows her material and she facilitates the information in a manner that is engaging. I am excited to complete this course.",5
19251,"This course does not do a good job at teaching the material. The lecture videos gloss over the topics briefly, but do not give a thorough explanation of the core topics of the course. The quizzes will repeatedly test on terms not even remotely mentioned in any of the course materials.",2
81994,other than the quiz.. everything else was good.. quiz was not challenging enough..,4
38649,"Very very bad communication from the teachers. The 2nd MOOC was supposed to start I think 2.5 months ago, it did not start at the time of this review.They did not even bother to post some announcement to let the students know : ok course starts in x months.Making things worse, you cannot get a refund if you purchased the entire thing.",1

82368,Amazing course! Really helpful for people wanting to get in touch with new web development techniques.,5
18946,"Far more demanding than previous courses, and thus far more interesting. Lacks clear direction compared to previous courses which can be difficult to adjust to, it leaves you to your own devices so to speak and is challenging in that regard.",5
19272,The first week on MATLAB was a great refresher since I hadn't used MATLAB in a few years,5
94236,Excellent course. I feel like i know so much already even though we scratched the tip of the iceberg. Will definitely enroll in more advanced courses.,5

57398,Best Machine learning course,5
12722,Really good introduction to cryo-EM and EM in general!,5
17256,That's interesting course - a practical method of learning a theory topic. I like the way people interact in assignments. Thanks so much.,4
23102,This course should really be called BASICS of healthy cooking or for people with unhealthy habits. It is very basic! And very based on the US reality! Living in Europe and used to cooking healthy food for my family everyday I have not learned anything new! Very disappointing to see such a basic course being offered by big names as Stanford University.,1
85598,"Fascinating knowledge delivered by instructors whose first language is definitely not English and who make it difficult to learn by their bad grammar, pronunciation and overall monotonous tone of speaking. However, the knowledge gained in this course is fascinating and I am thankful to the instructors for attempting to instruct more people in regard to this field and the details of it.",3
99534,Great course,5
10527,nice teacher but the course is too succint.Each lecture is very short and theoritical with little visual content. the course could/should be more detailed and a section of the course should relate to backyard chicken farming as well. i wish there also had been a section on how to recognise different illnesses in chickens and demonstration on how to humanely kill a chicken for example.I enjoyed the course for what it was but i wish it had been taught with far more depth and breadth,2
41058,Fun and meaningful,5
75915,kind of okay but...,1
56231,"It's a must-take course for all people interested in mastering Machine Learning. I'm so glad I went through all the videos, review sessions and assignments!",5
68766,Great teachers. Great presentations. Great way to learn Machine Learning. Highly recommended.,5
3354,Very good course overall. It could dig into a little more detail but given the duration and workload it's still pretty good. I think it's targeted towards people who are either working or studying full-time and taking this on the side.,4
78454,Very Beginner Very hands on. Perfect if you have never programmed in python before. Or never programmed at all. Instructor is great.,5
88264,This is the best training to see if your project program is clear and possesses all the information required for its success,5
65060,Great Intro coursre,5
16000,This really gets you out of your box.,4
80570,"it is great Course,",5
39212,Although the course material is very good but what I believe is that Image processing is a course where only theory isn't sufficient. Programming assignments should have been made important and compulsory part of the course instead of just MCQ quizzes.This is the reason why Andrew Ng's Machine learning on coursera appears very engaging. Whatever they teach in theory has to be implemented as part of programming assignments which makes learning experience wonderful.I hope that you will give due importance to programming assignments from next session.,3
9260,"Very well taught, but I think the exercises were disjointed and did not always fit with what was being taught. Other than that, great course!",4
23610,"Very interesting, useful",5
88667,its definitely worth ending the specialization with this capstone. The quizzes are easy but I would recommend watching all the videos to understand how all the pieces fit together. The biggest takeaway for me was to see how the database size significantly shrinks when its normalized during the clean up process.,5
71987,"Excellent Course, clarified a lot of misinformation I've had about the business area of music. Learned several things during the copyright week. All weeks were fantastic.",5
30905,Very good course. It helped me revise and learn some correct grammar usage in short time.,4

Spergel, great interviews with specialists on many of the topics.Just one thing I miss in the course, it would be nice to check my understanding of the explanation in quizes.Nonetheless, great thanks for the course!",5
26806,"This is fantastic course, everything is clearly resented. Foundation parts are just excellent - they give knowledge what's going on behind the curtain. Everyday I was launching next video with true excitement.And last but not least, Yaakov Chaikin is a great tutor!",5

65909,If you love movies and psychology this course mixed both great,5
50921,It is very intense and full of useful information that you can not find anywhere else except if you are practicing this specialization for a long time,4
105979,The course covers important statistical concepts pertaining to risks and explains the interpretations and calculation in details. A must do.,5
49960,"The course was highly informative, entertainingly presented and does not require an unreasonable amount of time to complete. It serves well as an introduction to programming, especially the two course projects, where the peer review system works well. The instructors and mentors show a commitment to helping students and improving the already well-run course. An unusual and welcome feature of this Coursera course is the immediate verification of one's typing. My only criticism is the lack of downloadable written/pdf material related to the course, although students who go on to learn programming languages will likely relearn much of the knowledge they gained here.",4
95298,The instructor should lower the speed,4
28993,Fantastic course if you are interested in happyness!,5
11199,A wonderfully designed course. Really helpful and gives an in-depth view of the science of communication.,5
93715,Everything initial to learning R Programming.,5
94649,Not the best course of the serie. It is a pity because I had great expectation in this course.,2
82198,the coarse needs a lot of improvement for the explaining way and the data offered way,1
80411,Very interesting subject with an excelent teacher .,5
9597,Awesome tutorial.,5
59968,"Systematic and clear, great course",5
5965,"I finished the first session of Master Algorithmic Programming Techniques, the Algorithmic Toolbox course. This is an amazing course. To review why this course (and series) is awesome:1) 25 + programming assignments, ranging from easy to advanced.2) Unlike many other CS courses, this course allows multiple programming languages. You have choices of C C++, Java, Python2, Python3. They may add more to the list :).3) Super active forum, the learners come here to debate approaches and share knowledge a lot. There were so many times I'm convinced my algorithm can't be optimized anymore, then another guy came in with another genius idea.4) Plus, the instructor, Mr. Alex S. Kulikov is a super nice guy, he made 300+ forum posts in the first session alone, to guide learners thoroughly.Comprehensive grader: grades you on correctness, time use, memory use. You have no choice but to optimize all 3 aspects to pass.This course has premium access. However, both the quality and quantity are well worth the price. You can read other learners' comments and many agree with this.",5
10246,"Great and valuable knowledge, focused explanations, great teachers. One of the best courses in the specialization.",5
49784,Good introductory course,4
83096,"Excellent course, pretty challenging difficulty. Thanks to the instructors for putting together some very interesting material.",5
71889,This was an amazing course that offered a veritable treasure trove of information. TAKE. THIS. COURSE!!!,5
26553,This course really shows what you need to know in order to start coding high-quality webpages. It'll open a whole new world to those people who are insterested in coding websites and deploying web apps. I recommend it!,5
79011,"Good instruction, even though the final project is little bit hard.",5
85007,An excellent course which will bring in a sense of confidence (to program in python) for all who diligently complete it.,4
61438,"For an introductory course it is ok, however can't help get the feeling that the material is just skimmed through. In an effort to structure each session in the same way, detail has been missed out. Practical examples and hands-on exercises are very inadequate. Not impressed.",3
11245,"It is good if you are looking for basic information, I did not finish the entire course, I think it was not right for me.",4
7732,Really inspired cursus.,5
78421,The class was well organized and the lecture videos were very clear.,5
88001,"Nice course, nicely presented. Lots of information about origins and ties together nice.",5
5262,"Good course for someone with background of statistics. The instructors are lucid but cover a lot in 7 weeks, they delve into intuitive insights of statistics. It is advisable to keep a textbook handy while undergoing this course. In the end good job University of Amsterdam!",5
3285,"Very nice course, but it would be even better if it was about Angular 2, since it is to become the standard AngularJS is/was.",4
68331,I believe it would be very useful if the authors could provide a lecture review about python commands. Specially the ones they are going to use during the course.,5
21956,"I saw two main issues with this course: 1) dated lecture videos, oftentimes with R code that can't be replicated using up-to-date packages, and 2) lack of thoughtful design: example after example after example after example doesn't really teach you anything.",2
74134,Simple to understand and helps student to learn programming from scratchwith simplest examples,4
24888,I really like it. Thank you!,5
21147,It was a wonderful experience to read the structure of data before delving into the advanced statistical levels of data analysis.The need for inclusion or exclusion of dependent variables or dimension reduction in regression analysis can be intuitively understood and visualized using Data Exploratory techniques and then we have the clue as what to do in the next level.It is like putting the whole characteristic of the data under full control.,5
103824,"An ok introduction to Swift Programming, but I can see people who do not have previous development experience struggling with this course. Also lecturers were virtually nonexistent on the forums to help with questions which is disappointing since it is a paid course which implies you are paying for their time and effort not just the certificate.Best advice for people taking this course is to get through the material as early as possible and give yourself as much time as possible to work on the project, don't wait till the last week to work on it.Would also suggest the following changes to improve the course and help people understand the material better:1. Have a programming exercise to complete at the end of every week to prove you have understood the material taught, a quiz alone with 10 or less questions is not enough. The course ramps up way to quickly with the project if all you have been doing is following the videos, students should be practicing and proving they know the work far more often.2. Provide a clearer project brief since it was clear many people did not understand all the requirements.3. Provide a video of what the final project should do in general to make it even clearer.Overall I didn't have a bad experience with the course, just disappointed that it was really bear bones, there were too few opportunities to prove your understanding, it was poorly managed and the lack of interaction from the lecturers a massive problem when they are being paid to help out, not just provide videos and forget about the students.",3
47683,"The course exceeded my expectations.My main reason for doing the course was to give me ideas as to how to learn a new language (my third) after the age of 60 and in a new country and environment. Needless to say, I am encouraged!",5
64485,Very good course. Highly recommended.,5
12601,Excellent introductory course to complex analysis,5
12181,This was a very informative course. It will be interesting to see how the laws will change with The United Kingdom exiting the European Union.,5
12393,"Very Good Course! I'd never used spark before, and doing (and passing) the assignment on it was very rewarding!",5
8487,"Despite my busy work schedule I had fun taking this course especially because of the forum that diverse learners from all around the globe participated it. Twice I got stuck with running hadoop and other learners had posted the solution so I tried their suggestions and I got unstuck! I appreciate those who put in extra work to make my learning easier and fun. Honestly, that was the incentive that made me to complete this course for I was about to drop out. Thank you.",5
71434,Fantastic introduction to functional programming and Scala.,5
49107,Clear explanation on the language usage,5
21513,"This was a fun course. Information is presented in digestible, bite sized pieces. The peer review process works fast and well--I was surprised how perceptive the critiques of my photos were.",4
81361,This class really helps me,5
71175,Best course by Scala!,5
28980,Its very enjoyable! I loved hearing about being happy and the resources to it.,5
22060,Amazing! Excellent delivery of content and virtuosic playing at the same time,5
36732,"A fabulous course that gives you the true aspect of statistics into real applications with the help of a realistic dataset and a software package. Many thanks to the lecturers and the developers for creating this course. This is of great help for people like me, who have a keen interest in getting into analytics but needs a direction of where to start from.",5
71310,"Very good course! I noticed some of the instructions are out of date (e.g. there are examples of where to go on the website, but the website format has changed). I wish I understood more of what sbt and the IDE were doing behind the scenes. It seems like there is a lot of structure built into making the assignments function properly and I would like to better understand how to make my own project with similar level of complexity / capabilities.",5
159,it's a very good an easy to understand first inmersion in the world of 3d printing,5

8354,Great Course! Gives lots of insight into big data1,5
93860,"Difficult to follow if you are new to any type of programming. This is not a beginner's course. Best to take this course after trying Swirl, Data Camp, or Code School.",2
1700,Great Course. I enjoyed being introduced to Business Metrics while taking this class.,5
64663,"Deep, thorough, complex analysis. Clear explanation of quite difficult topics.",5
68645,"SFrame & GraphLab tutorials were great, Really liked how it was presented .Loving this Course !",5
34592,"It was an interesting course, and some of the advices that have been given are quite useful. But I suppose it has no great impact on my lifestyle, as I have enough activity already. But for those who have really sedentary way of life is very helpful.",3
100415,Really liked the supplementary materials provided in the course. Also liked hearing about research from various researchers.,4
18021,"The course is really good. However, in some situations, it is very high level and the instructor assumes that the audience know what he say. I would prefer to see some other figures for the cloud use and the use of the cloud in reality.",4
90701,Great course,5
32658,Perfect Course to learn how you can move in game industry!,5
49795,awesome introduction to embedded computing and IoT.,5

91797,Excellent content and instructions. Fun to learn!,5
56406,Hope it can help me through my future work!,5
106517,"Before attending this course, the world of UI Design looked complicated and daunting. It was really a pleasure attending it through Coursera. The videos are comprehensive, easy to understand and the assignments help a lot towards feeling more confident and eager to explore what's next towards UI Design specialization.",5
28613,I am really enjoying this course. Its so nicely planned out and put together. Prof Raj speaks so eloquently thats easy to follow him. I love the way instructions are provided to submit the assignments. In other coursera courses I have mostly quit because of the lack of proper instructions during the assignments and also additional help. Not this one.What I dont like is the pop up quiz. Its not that the quiz is bad but the pop up destroys the flow of the topic. You could have executed the quiz just like the polls where there is a pause by the Prof and then comes the quiz. It would ensure a coherence in the videos.But overall a great course.,4
78136,Good start course for new leaner,5
28492,Excellent course. Professor Raj has explained things in a very simple and power,5
106619,Excellent starter for strategy concept and work-frame. the course is broaden your view from strategist's perspective.,5
21056,High level course with great instructors.,5
41663,"Maybe at begin, it is a little difficult. But once you can catch up with your teacher and classmates, you will find it will be OK. If you are a beginner with little knowledge or no basic knowledge about C# program, it is a good challenge for you to have a try. If you are a experienced programmer or already get some program concept/skill(no matter it is C/C++ or Java), it's good for you to have a practice.",5
55821,"I, really enjoyed every second of it!",5
81926,Leaves out so much of basic stuff. I think this course is for 4th graders.,2
80766,"Good context, however, long videos, didnâ€™t catch my attention.",2
75058,"Great course to begin your python journey. Assessments were relatively tougher than what instructor teaches, but you're provided with a lot of online self study material. So its a trade-off between the speed of the course and challenging assessments.",4
7795,Thank you so much!,5
2472,BEST COURSE FOR ANALYTICS PERSON.,5
35690,"A great insight into rural and urban management which could be greatly improved with more challenging (longer) assignments. Great video material and instructors, but I would have enjoyed writing and peer assessing more in-depth articles as opposed to condensing as much information as possible into a simple 200-400 words.",4
44225,"This was a very interesting class. The principles covered were helpful and I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning how to learn. As I went through it my recurring thought was ""Why didn't they teach me these concepts in middle school?""",4
16784,Interesting and Informative,4
20273,"Presentation is so boring and dry, I could not bring myself to watching past the first couple of videos.",1
5568,"very nice, the presentation about is so clear and practical",5
98895,Well designed and rich stuffed course,5
93188,There is a disconnect between the video lectures and the assignments/quizzes.,1
88467,"Well-thought, qualitatively designed and, in the mean time, brief course. Very simple structure (definitely a good thing!) and simulation videos make Psychological First Aid very interesting subject to learn. All actions are analyzed and explained in detail. Would recommend it not only to psychologists, physicians or other doctors, but also to those who are interested in psychology itself and have no academic background in this area. You may discover some new stuff that will be both curious and useful for you",5
87421,special thanks to Dr chuckAnd a request for office hours in INDIA.May be I will get a chance to meet him.I will be very thankful.,5
102623,"Robert Wright is analyzing buddhist thesis through the scope of modern science. The course helped me to understand better the effects of meditation and human behavior, while backing up the arguments with tons of research and latest theories of human perception and decision making. I liked also numerous guest hostings with various insights from different fields starting with monks and ending with top scientists. Highly interesting and meaningful course.",5
21662,"The course was very interesting. It touched upon all currently employed techniques in good detail. The lab-based videos were the most interesting. However, the lectures were too long. It would be a brilliant course if the lectures were cut short and made to the point.",3
91401,Thanks,5
55071,"Great at giving a fundamental, necessary understanding of machine learning. The quiz system drove me crazy--not as helpful at reinforcing understanding. Big value is in the programming assignments--helped much more to reinforce understanding.",4
11435,"One of the best courses I've ever had (including classes at my University)...Starting fro the basics, explaining the difference between numerical, categorical data, discrete and continuous variables, Prof. Klopper gave me a better insight in the subject.I am extremely grateful.Kind regards,Diana",5
92210,Very interesting course.,5
84447,very interesting way likeable teaching.I wish if there were more professors using similar teaching approach.This is my 9 th course on coursera and only 2nd i completed -- cause i could get it !Thanks,5
86397,Thank you for helping me with study this course!!!,5
26694,Very useful!,5
7210,So useful and focus on main basic aspects.,4
57233,"only theory no practice. I don't need math at this point as I don't know even how to build simple machine learning program. Programming assignments come with no explanation. It is not possible to finish this course without learning from other sources on the web, materials attached to this course are not enough to understand the subject. I have trouble understanding what the teacher is trying to teach from the very beginning of course.",1
82329,"Great introduction to Meteor.Its good for prototyping. To be production ready you need to learn more stuff, like security and performance.",5
46635,"This is the first class I had ever taken on the open online classes. I took it to be prepared to take other classes. Honestly, I figured it would be kind of like a reminder class on studying. The Professors are amazing. The have set a high standard for other classes. There was never a dull moment. It was so much fun and I learned so much NEW information but Not only did I learn it but I completely understand why it works. it is great having insight into the brain and how to have it work for you. This is not the standard study skill class at all. The names says it all. I still surprise myself on how enthusiastic I am when I get the opportunity to use the information acquired . It really works . it's like being able to depend on a really good friend. They are always there to help you pull through and won't leave you hanging. My favorite is the Pomodoro technique. if you procrastinate this is the one to help you get stuff done. I have incorporated a lot of what I learned into my daily life. After being in many other classes, I have to say this is the BEST class I have taken. It's the knowledge I use most. Keep up the good work Barb and Terry!!!",5
1383,"This is a great course and the practical assignments are really cool. But I would like to have more assignments where we have to implement the data structures ourselves, because I thing the best way to learn an algorithms is by going throw the process of implementing and debugging it",5
76439,Great course to start playing with programming ! Dr. Chuck you rock :),5
27047,"Really enjoyed course and lecturer's style, but had an inexplicable craving for Chinese food throughout.",5

75314,Great teacher!!!,5
23357,"This has been an excellent Course. The content itself is very clear and gives you an enormous background about food and eating habits, although is focused mostly in the western diet in USA I think that at least in America continent an other parts of the globe eating habits are similar, Public health is a great concern and I think that in this way we should change completely our habits and stop eating processed food. Congrats Stanford University more courses like this one.",5
5114,"A really great course. Simple to follow and understand, but provides insights into the basics of statistics. Almost no math which is good news for non-experts and makes the course more accessible for a broader audience. The lecturers explain the intuition behind the fundamental things in statistics, which I find very important before studying the statistical tests (inferential statistics). Feels like it opened my eyes.Thank you very much Matthijs Rooduijn and Emiel van Loon!",5
80340,Excellent course - covers many strategies on how to negotiate as well as providing insight into the negotiation process.,5
4058,"Absolutely exceptional course - I have learned so much in preparation for commencing my Graduate Certificate in Arts and Cultural Management via correspondence. This course not only provided great management insights and how institutions implement their product to the consumer, it provided up to date methods of data processing and insight into marketing approach. I will definately watch out for more courses with Bocconi. I could not be more grateful for the material and the opportunity to learn this much at no cost. Thanks for your time and amazing effort in putting together this course and thank you to our amazing host, Andrea Rurale for being the enthusiastic, professional guide through these learning modules.",5
34136,An excellent course it helped me to think and review,5
86064,Very good course.,5

78447,I Just loved the amazing course. This should be Good to learn through. I am very glad about my Class Teacher.,5
92174,A great introduction to database design and SQL with Python in hand.,5
13006,"I really liked this course. I learned so many details that will help me to improve my writing skills. I consider that the information is well developed because even though the topic is complex the professors were very precise when organizing the material.Easy to follow, to understand, and to memorize. Professors, thank you so much for your dedication preparing each video.",5
85762,I enjoyed this course materials and tutorials.,5
41385,Poorly designed and explained. You do not really gain much knowledge from this course.I would not recommend my friends and basically others to take this course. There are far better courses out there for much cheaper prices.,1
105665,Great course but content and quizzes need updating. Certificate would be nice.,3
47863,"really practical and interesting course. I learn better now and get less frustrated when i forget something, because I know how learning works now. Thanks!",4
97220,Superb course! The topics are beautifully explained. Very pragmatic and systematic approach to the issues.,5
23005,Really good course. I have learned a lot.,5
57168,easy to understand. appropriate for people with no basis.,5
38137,"Great material, not too in depth but if you know some programming then you will at least be able to properly read code now and know what to google, which I think is the most important for learning a new programming language.",5
67563,A little too superficial and hand waving.,3
33443,Best of the online course for understanding HTML5.,5
39336,"I still never quite grasped how to use some of the tools, but I think it was more of an issue with me not having a grasp on the product I want to market rather than the program itself. The listening tools we got out of this mooc are incredible, if you have a PC.",5
13306,Was really good,5
46646,First time I am going through such an awesome topic and surely it will help me in my academic development.Thank you coursera for this course.,5
58027,This is awesome course!,5
49006,"OK introduction to material properties, but not rigorous (leaves out definitions, motivation and conclusions/consequences) and skips some things that come up on the quizzes. No worked examples.",2
4763,Excellent and very interesting presentation of a wonderful subject.,5
95274,I learned in this course that pandas is a way deeper rabbit hole than it appears on the surface. However rather than teaching me pandas this course mostly just helped me verify that I was learning pandas. The questions in this class need more scaffolding. I ended up skipping most of the in-video questions because I felt that the work I was investing in getting them correct was not teaching me much. More scaffolding could fix this.,4
39240,Excellent format and path from the beginning to the end. Martin Vendel provides a great learning experience based on real-life examples and forces you to put your knowledge into a bigger perspective.,5
85745,"I indeed acquired a detailed set of structured knowledge from a very practical perspective, this has given me a different perception and better approach to translate actions and activities around me especially in projects.Special thanks to Coursera",5

37750,"This course is very effective to build up the basic foundation of HTML,CSS and JS.",4
36046,"It is not free. They just sell the certificates. There is not any free statement about accomplishment of the course, so nobody will knows that you have completed it. In the future you have not got anything to show in your CV.I want my Statement of Accomplishment.",1
54574,Great introductory course for general audiences. There could be much more material covered in the math/technical aspect and the lab assignment could use more difficulties.,4
98953,After this course you'll be able to develop a functional web app using Rails' build-in database. Now you can produce your own data using all the options Rails has to offer; that's nice because you don't depend on external API's to get the back-end stuffs. Recommended!,5
4564,"The course has some valuable information, however course materials and videos are not so helpful. If you already have some knowledge about statistics and excel, it will be a lot easier to follow the instructor's lectures, otherwise I don't feel how a beginner could really follow up on this course. Some topics are run through so quickly that they are confusing to students.",3
10664,very informative with practical inputs.,5
43857,Do yourself a favor and take this class! It has made me a believer. I believe that I can successfully learn things that I never thought I could! There are so many tools given in this course to help you become a successful learner! Thank you Barbara!,5

2883,I miss more homework.,4
9306,Videos are actually enjoyable to watch. The prof is an interesting dude.,5
7341,This is a great course and I would refer this course to anyone willing to learn.,5
94653,I feel that the lecture material lacks proper explanation of the key concepts but the questions in quizzes are good although the lectures should have been more conceptual rather than theoretical,2
65895,"As mentioned in the lecture, we take memory for granted before understanding it. I personally learnt a lot from the lecture and it helps me to realize the situation of the elderly around us.",5
16510,Wonderful course and the teacher is very well prepared.,4
29610,It's absolutely amazing! I highly recommend every non-native english speaker to take this course.,5

52467,"The scope, content and presentation were all very well done.",5
78404,"Very suitable for new comers of programming. For me who has programming experience for more than 10 years and just want to catch up with the mainstream of programming in Python, it's a bit too simple. But that's my problem, not the class. The class is arranged nicely, Chunk presented very well and clear. I like it very much",5

But the worst were the quizzs. 90% of the answers to the multiple-choice questions were the top option!! I could have pass the tests without having listen to the videos. Were those tests or jokes? You should do this class only if you know absolutely nothing about economics, because this is the most basic class.",1

25645,"I learned a lot of new things throughout this course. At first, my skeptical approach was: ""well that I've seen on YouTube"", but after 1st week I started realizing it gives you more - the understanding of how games made, what it takes and what you're capable of when left with limited knowledge and some ready-to-use tools. This month wasn't that easy for me and what I know for sure - if not for college-like system and approach - I would've put studies away to solve life problems, which would probably result in putting it away for longer.",5

96412,Very good video lectures,5
41064,"It was an entertaining course which you can build things on paper. Which is nice if you are not friendly with computers. The only not-so-liked part was try to fit the assignments in a single side A4 page only. We had 4 assignments in each of the assignments except one, we are encouraged to build our assignments on previous assignments.

The theme of the course is to provide insight into the approaches used to investigate approximation algorithms for NP hard problems and the theoretical techniques used to assess the effectiveness of the approximation algorithm against the best answer. The production quality of the lecture videos and slides was high.The content of the quizzes and assignments was mostly appropriate and well organized. However, the authors appeared to struggle with the platform. At times there were comments such as, you need to enter something in the box but it was not actually being used. Answers to the assignments required using substantial mathematical notation, but LaTex was not enabled in the discussion or text entry boxes (no longer available in the Coursera platform??) so the work around was to upload answers to a bunch of questions as a single PDF document. Flow of the individual modules (lectures, slides, quizzes) was inconsistent, varying from week to week.",4

62122,"Really poor approach to grade this course. Regardless of the effort put in on assignments, peer reviews are inconsistent, unguided and poor as a result, bringing down the final grade one is likely to obtain on a course. There is also a limited course support from the staff and no feedback in general for any of the issues raise. Personally I would not recommend",1
12961,"Pretty average and way too short/fast paced videos. Felt like it was put together on the fly. I don't usually review but this was not great, the reading material they linked to was the best content overall.",2
105966,"This was a great course; very good explanations teoretical and practice, you gave us powerful tools to analyze data and took the necesary time for cover the topics.

Videos are clear, informative, have a good mix of theoretical and real-world examples and Michel Girardin (one of the lecturers) has really good, original examples to explain concepts and also keep one entertained (online courses with hours of financial theory can be tough in this regard sometimes!).

66724,The videos didn't work correctly (sound and subtitles). I suggest to fix the problems because it is hard to understand the content of the course if the problems reamin.,2
95765,"Assignments at times a bit hazy and there is very little guidance. In general the types of assignments do not lend themselves too well to peer review. This is far off the standard set by courses 1 and 2. Lectures seem a bit generic and although Liz Gerber tries to make it hands on, the subject matter really doesnt seem anywhere as tangible as when Klemmer presents it.",2
96352,Well Organized and very instructive. Thanks.,5

69387,Easy to understand and practice spoken Chinese.,5
91534,Easy learning and very helpful for an individual who are pursuing a career in project management.,5
98200,"Helpful introduction to conflict resolution. I appreciated having the various categories and causes mapped out. It makes it easier to talk about conflict once you've internalized the terms of the categories: interpersonal/intergroup/intercultural, values/economic/power, etc. Looking forward to the next installment of this course.",4
104200,awsome!!,5
30646,"This was a very well done course with many different ways to practice the skills being taught. There are a few bugs in the assignment section, particularly in week 4, that impacted students' ability to review one anothers' work.",4
38207,"This course is for the absolute beginner who has never heard of programming before, yet it makes an easy slide into web development for experienced software developer as well. The professor is simply awesome, lectures are perfectly organized (although a bit lengthy more than needed sometimes) and assignments are totally on point for beginners as well. I wish it was a bit more complicated and challenging, but for the targeted level, I guess it was ok.",5
43282,"I am 54 years old and, although impossible to have taken it when I studied my career back in the 80's, I regret not have taken it before. First thing I will do now is tell my kids to take it. Thanks a LOT.",5

87857,"This course is well-developed and well-delivered. If one is a complete novice, start at the beginning of this specialty on one's own schedule (on demand at the speed of light) and at an affordable price ($0) and be confident of significant advances in one's knowledge of internet function, in general, and Python, in particular. It is a brave new world. I often feel like Wylie Coyote staring through my toes. Suddenly realizing things have changed. This course fixes that feeling.",4

32288,"Wow! Is developing an app ""THIS"" simple if I know Angular! This course and the way it proceeds in each step gave me a lot of confidence that developing an android app is simple.I haven't started anything yet (I did not ""do"" the exercises), but the fact that ""I know. It is easy"" is a good enough take home from this course.",5
55618,"I would like to thank Prof. Ng for the understandable introduction into Machine Learning World. I learned insights of several commonly used algorithms in ML. Several good hints and tips are really good for dealing in programming in real world. Totally agree with the approach to use Octave, as it focus on the math (and what is happening in the algorithm) rather than getting lost in the tool chains of programming. The intuition about what is happening (how it works) really stands out in comparison to other course available (for not getting lost in the wild...).",5
44997,"I thought this course would be too difficult for me but the method and clarity of explanations gave me more and more confidence and taught me how to better deal with all the information on the course. The biology videos had to be watched and transcript read and subtitled but overall it was a great and illuminating experience. I re-trained 6 years ago to become a teacher of English and my trainer said I would never have the same relationship with the language again. She was right. And I continue to learn from that fact, it's so much more complex and fascinating and the chunks keep growing! I feel the same way about this course - Learning will never be the same again! And it's a very positive rewarding gift. THANKS to the whole LHTL Team. Avril.",4

103017,"This course was just amazing. Ecery single concept of the course is useful, widely explained and applied throughout the assignments. The final week is the best one because you apply all the concepts in a website.I think that if you don't have the chance to see results in your own website, you might still think you only learned the theory. However, I had the chance to apply my knowledge on my university's website and so far, its metrics have already started to improve. I hope that after reading this and finishing the course, you will be as delighted as I am now.",5
74530,Excellent teaching and guidance. I think dr. chunk is become my favorite tutor after this course. so I would like to work with dr. chuck in future whenever I'll do in ms. nice one! thanks a lot. I am looking forward next course of python with dr. chuck. :),5

14703,quite a beginning to a journey.,4
53848,"In my opinion, the sound quality is quite low and this makes it difficult to follow the lectures smoothly. And I found the current response in the FQA section of the course to this problem very unusefull and discouraging... .I am guessing that the course is not really meant for absolute beginners and some previous knowledge of programming and such is needed. I did not have any knowledge in those areas and I found it hard to follow everything mentioned in the course. So, I switched to another course on a different platform to be able to make the best of my time.",2
17365,It is a comprehensive course for learning quite up-to-date technology and concept.,4
13782,"Good class, good lectures. The plot devices taught are very specific, but helpful for beginning writers for whom conflict, and movement are not easy. I'm a beginning writer and I struggle with finishing a story because at some point I just think, well now what? what's supposed to happen?The class helps you push the characters into conflict, and make choices, which is the heart of a good story.My only complaint - the assignments were so structured that they were tedious. the peer reviews in this class were also painful. Reading other people's work, I felt like perhaps we needed less structure and more space to practice simpler techniques.But overall, i'm using what I've learned in my writing, and its definitely helped!",4

87362,"Another great course taught by a master. This class is perfect for anyone who wants to learn how to retrieve and read data from the web with Python. If you are new to programming, take the previous Python courses in this series since this course builds on concepts learned in those courses.",5

15106,Good overview of existing tools but more information will be useful to dig into the data world.,3
35596,Great course! Peer feedback has been less than helpful.,4
80874,The lectures are fairly good. However the course could have been made more valuable by either providing the slides used in each module or excerpts from the recommended book could have been provided instead of just an Amazon link to purchase the book.,5

103836,"Videos are poorly done and leave a lot of useful details out. There is zero support from staff in the forums. If you take this course, plan on spending a lot of time doing research on external sources in order to gain an understanding of the very broad and lacking in detail videos.To improve this course, the instructors should:-provide links to at least one textbook on Swift-add Mentors to the course to help students in the forums-include a repository of code snippets for practice of the concepts",2
77611,"The professor is nice, but it is a little bit easy.",4

67627,"My overall experience with this Specialization, in general, and this 1st Course, in particular, is very positive.On the positive side, I really like the fact that the Courses are practice-oriented and provide not only theoretical frameworks, but also insights from experts, practical guidance, and evidence-based best practices.Also, the idea of applying Team-Based Learning (TBL), in the forms of Readiness Assurance Tests (RATs) and scenario-based RAT Application Exercises, for assessing participants' learning, is excellent!However, there are a couple of downsides, that's why I'm not giving a 5 star positive feedback.The first problem is that not all of the required readings are freely available via the Coursera platform, or elsewhere online. I appreciate the excellent quality of the chosen materials, but, if it becomes compulsory to spend more than US $100 for buying books, then the total cost of this Specialization elevates quite a lot, given that I had to pay â‚¬162 for it. On my opinion, there should be at least a note in the description of both the Specialization and the Courses about these requirements, in order to make an informed decision before enrolling.The second downside has to do with Course 1 and Course 2 overlapping materials. I'm referring to guest interview videos. That's mainly a problem of the 2nd Course, as there are almost no guest interviews in this Course, and the one interview provided is already available in Course 1. I understand that the topics discussed apply to the topics of both Courses, but, still, I find it an unnecessary repetition.The last problem is about the dates that the Courses are run. Course 1 runs during a given period, Course 2 is on demand, but it makes sense to attend it before Course 3, that also runs during a given period, which overlaps with the period of the 1st Course. Sorry, this makes it very difficult to attend everything and to seriously focus, as it's always about running for deadlines, especially when one has to produce three (3) Board Effectiveness Assessment Reflection (BEAR) papers :( .",4
38151,"Plus: Lots of information for a beginner course, covers a lot of ground in HTML/CSS/JS. Some applications requiring building web-pages and JS programs to get hands-on experienceNegative: HTML/CSS and to a less extent JS introduced pretty much as a list of disconnected tags/attributes etc, leaves some confusion as to how it all fits together, but that probably can't be avoided when covering a lot of ground in a short 3 weeks beginner course",4
32910,Greate!,5
9746,This course is very awesome. Professor's unconventional way of explaining the concepts really helped me learn some of the tough concepts. I really enjoyed Calculus for the first time :),5

104991,"Very disappointed with how the transition from the old Coursera platform to the new platform has been handled: lots of instances of the ""see lecture X"" in the quizzes where the reference is now just wrong because the lectures got renumbered, an almost complete lack of community TA/mentors, and no explanations from anyone as to how the new platform works.Perhaps the worst of all has been the almost complete lack of acknowledgement of any problems from the folks at JHU. This feels like it's just been dumped on the students without any real testing or any appropriate resources to sort out any problems.",1

In my search for interesting course related to astronomy I found this one.Although I am only half way through the course I state that this is the most compelling course I have taken on Coursera. Since I have more then some knowledge of scientific method, physics and other topics talked about in the course, but not as much in astronomy I find the course tailored for me. Especially taking into account that this course is in the right spot between popular knowledge and a little bit of science and engineering.Prof. Impley is excellent in explaining, even amazing at some points :)",5

I believe he knows the English language very well but, between his deep accent and speaking very quickly, there are a number of times I cannot understand what he is saying. This is reflected at times when reading the transcript below each video. I found it better to slow the video down to 0.75X the regular speed to hear him but that did not remove all of the difficulty.",3

A tip for those thinking of just enrolling in one or two random courses of the five specialized courses, enroll in all. It is worth it even if you think you know. For instance, some of the papers in Advance Writing expect you to know some of the previous courses info and that could lead to some misunderstandings or struggles on quiz/peer reviews.",5

94033,"I think the course needs to be restructured in order to be more practical and in order to go more deeply into theoretical material. Most of the course is a little superficial. Most classes could be summarized. For exemple, in talking about selection procedures, the only tool discussed more deeply is interview. The was no discussion about personality, psychological test or other tools. Most contents of Amy`s classes are abstract. Stacy class, however is more practical. It is a nice course, but it can go more deeply into theory and most classes could be summarized.",3

51585,"I was astonished how well this course works on-line! I was not expecting so much. The course is very well structured and you REALLY LEARN. If I could add some things, these would be: 1) writing the answers in pinyin should be made a bit less strict, avoiding the need for accents specially, and 2) would be great some way to check ""our pronunciation"" and the tasks (homework) that we submit. Apart from the automatic correction of tests made easy because of options, when free writing it needs to send some feed back. But again, GREAT Job to Mrs Liu, our tutor from the University of Peking. What a pleasure!",5
86750,"Good, too much of seeing the professors face while in the middle of explaining code. Not that he's ugly, but when looking at code, it helps to keep it on the screen a bit longer, rather than showing his face momentarily and then back to the code.

105981,Learn a lot!,5
29275,"Good information contained within the course which has sparked my interest in continuing to learn and build on my small amount of knowledge. Lower rating than I would usually give for a course because of the way the lectures are delivered. Having a lecturer standing in front of a brick wall, plugging his book and not really connecting with online students was not great. A couple of times during the lectures I dozed off and had to re-run them. If the plugging of own material was removed and the background and tone of voice were altered this could be a captivating and interesting course.",3

96552,Great class and awesome teacher. Keep it up.. !,5
9294,"Great teacher with a very interesting content and approach. To totally benefit from this course, going through the associated Mooculus print is really complementary to the video. This enthusiastic mathematician, beyond the raw mathematics, will give you insights, practical and inspired examples or applications, interests, and much more. You might end up seeing integral calculus as an epic rpg battle versus an ogre after this course (special thanks to the professor for this amazing image ), but you would have been well trained, fully equipped, and wisely guided.",5
106815,Learning never should be assumed by the source. Online sources too can outshine other platforms. This course is doing wonders to me and is definitely making me a better writer.,5
54393,Overall a great course. It's hard to believe that it is free.One recommendation: It would be nice to have supplemental readings for the later lessons like there are for the earlier ones.,5
93479,i feel this courses needs to be split into two different streams. One for beginners and one for people who are more comfortable with coding and R. I think that the learning curve is too steep for a part time course.,3
1239,Very good explanations,4
53538,"It is a good course for novice to learn machine learning. There are many practical cases making learning algorithms easy to understand. After learning such a course, I feel that I gained the ability to design a basic machine learning system to solve realistic problems.",5
63183,Great in-depth lecture.,5
83845,"A very good class, with a talent teacher.",5
82828,"The course tackles an interesting topic: why do we enjoy music?But there are two problems with this course:1) It fails to provide convincing evidence for its claims; the evidence is circumstantial and flimsy.2) The lecturer is, how shall I say this politely, monotonic. He lacks enthusiasm.My recommendation: if you are interested in the topic, take this course and make your own mind up. Maybe it will convince you. If not, you will have learnt a bit about human perception a sound perception.",2
99283,Great course!!! Like it very much!!! Thanks a lot!!!,5
21739,"The course of getting data is a little difficult, however, the cleaning data course is excellent. Using the package of ""dplyr"", I learn how to clean data effectively. My suggestion is that getting data from website can teach less, and the cleaning data course can add more practices.",4
25932,it is perfect course,5

7900,"It is very helpful and informative, especially for moms like me. I hope there will be more like these. Thank you Maya.",5
1493,"Super course! I love all the assignments. and the upload-and-feedback system. The lectures are also very good. I did not use the interview questions.Getting the course done in time and working full time simultaneously is very hard, though, but I don't really have any programming experience with me, so that might make it harder.",5
81447,"Uncomfortable to watch and also a very outdated layout of the course, feels like a bad 90s American talk show.",2

58304,"Thanks a lot Andrew NG for one of the best and most descriptive online courses I took so far. Just as a small point open to improvement, in MATLAP/Octave assignments, students may be encouraged more to apply the core steps of the algorithms on their own.",4
16652,Course really introduced me to the basic concepts that I need in database design. I really appreciate.,4
1188,Limited in scope but very good for the time/topics it covers.,5
63253,"The videos are very static, the content good but the course progresses in a rather slow way.The thick Dutch accent and the lack of diversity in the speakers profile is rather paramounting (but I have followed only the first three chapters).",2
10171,"a very good course for cloud study. the content is colorful , a lot of examples to support deep understanding of the concepts. The biggest drawback is that maybe there can be some small programming assignment after each week's course. And the standard answers of the Week5 quizz have some bugs.",5
98301,Very useful and enjoyful course.,5
98526,"Very enthusiastic lecturer, which made learning that much more enjoyable! The course content is fantastic. My only comment is the grading system for the assignments / how the assignments are designed - in my opinion the grading system could be improved to reflect efforts and correct submission done by students.",4
21047,"The course provides with a detailed overview on how the EU is functioning. If you intend to study the EU law, this course is very helpful to understand the basics.",5
63478,"Truly excellent course content that really serves as an excellent entry for people new to this field.My one crib is with the testing methods employed in the course. The quizzes were far too easy and the peer review system does not really give comprehensive feedback. I understand that grading is a huge problem for online education, and I wont claim to have the answers to this, but this really needs to be fixed to help the students learn more.",5
5388,"it is an amazing subject, and it is well taught by professor Impey. It was so much fun the way he presented it, with a lot of nice multimedial material but also a lot of hard work to complete the course.",5
1989,The concepts that I learnt are very useful and interesting.,5
97036,I found this course very helpful in its format and content.,5

48995,"Indeed, very nice lessons of important concepts in Materials Engineering. Helped me a lot.",5
61638,"Incorrect references, subtitles that do not follow the video. Questions in the questionnaires that have not been studied and which one does not even know where to find references. The worst course of this certificate.",1
66461,"The interviews are excellent; this is a very thought-provoking class. However, all of the assignments are written, and there is one very week. Might not be the ideal workload for busy people, but the lectures are worth taking the course.",4
5319,Great class,5
71670,"Key to Excel, enough said.",5
63438,"Best MOOC of self development. Often we never discussed topics like how to change field specially when we grow older, reason is, proof less myth spreaded in the society about learning new things at old age. This MOOC debunked such myth and also give insightful coverage of different aspect of mindshift. If you are reading this review I would personally recommend to take this MOOC if you want mindshift.",5
88302,"An excellent finale for the program, giving us the oportunity to apply most of the knowledge received through the different courses. The capstone project is clear, easy to understand in terms of structure and requirements. It lacks some of the contents of the course but most of the content is included. Once again thanks to Ms Meloni, all the team from UCI and Coursera, keep the good work!",5
59491,"Fantastic course. Great mix of practical examples and theory. Good pace in the videos, great organization and clear explanations. The assignments are very well put together: difficult but with different checks built in along to way to help catch programming bugs.",5
45858,"I would recommend this course to anyone who has never really thought about the art of learning or who had a less than stellar early experience with leaning and is getting back into it as an adult. Backed with many references and verified science, the techniques grouped here will help anyone willing to put in the time and apply them.",5
2913,"Many of the problem sets ask you to apply theorems in ways that have not been demonstrated. If a student makes a mistake, no feedback is given other than, ""That is not the right answer"".",2
32944,was very helpful for me as a beginner,5
15540,"Great course, the professors are passionate and very informative.",5
55038,Excellent course and very well taught. Really like the resources and Prof. Ng's explanations,5
61292,"Brilliant course, I would highly recommend anyone taking the HSK test to use these courses by Peking University to prepare themselves!",5
31403,"There was interesting information in the class, but the peer review questions were not well developed to stimulate thought and new ideas. Many of the answers I read were just repetitions of what was learned in class. I think the objectives and expectations could have been more clearly communicated and the statement themselves better thought out. I also did not find the peer review process to be that productive as a grading tool. The parameters for grading were extremely simple and the feed back was quite subjective from students that did not understand the assignments.While I learned some useful information, I won't continue with this course.",3
6321,Really interesting. Plenty of new knowledge for me.The additional material was really useful.,5
20244,"I have watched all the videos provided for this course and I think it's very educative, simple and well organized for a better understanding. The only thing I think lacking is example of real conflict situations like those between and within states, those between citizens and their elected governments etc. and conflict resolution skills or approaches used both nationally and internationally to resolve them. Thanks again once more for such a wonderful lesson on conflict resolution, it's My pleasure to learn from the online courser classes.",5
42549,Very interesting and pleasant course. I recommand it.,5

56839,It's a wonderful course. But I think the assignments are a bit difficult for design students like me to accomplish.,5
92274,Thank You!!!,5
85310,A delightful course. Professor Richard Adelstein's lectures are simply amazing. His way of conveying information are so enticing so that it makes easier to understand the subject. I'm really very pleased an grateful for such an wonderful opportunity to take part in this wonderful course.,5
42373,This was really good course. It was very detailed. I do think that some of the peer evaluations should be more specific.,5
23906,Design was the one we have longed for,5
103783,Professor Hess is amazing!,5
68059,Excellent introduction to basic concepts of machine learning. I will continue to follow the other courses in the specialization.,5
52007,"I am about to finish this course and I loved it. It is a great overview of the theories of SLA and although it says it takes 6 weeks, as I am on vacation now, I ended up finishing it in four days, working for about 4-5 hours/day. So, I highly recommend it to anyone interested in teaching languages.",5
48889,"Really liked this course, great balance of theory and putting it to practice on current issues at work. Got such great input from other people in the course on the first two assignments especially - very insightful and actionable.",4
34702,"Organised, Resourceful and Relevant course",5
52053,"Thank you, Dr. Chamovitz! I enjoyed this course. I did WAPK 1 a few years back as well. Please do create many more courses on plant biology - yours is the only one available on Coursera. Some feedback points: 1) Very little interaction and moderation on the discussion forums. There are many interesting points posted there, but no instructor intervention. 2) After listening to the videos i really did not enjoy the reading material provided - perhaps some other sites would be better. 3) The course syllabus is not enough to gauge whether the course is basic, medium or advanced level. Perhaps an indicator would help. For example, in Week 3 content on photosynthesis I was expecting a much more detailed discussion. It would be great to have more advanced courses from you and your team. Your overview explanations are extremely lucid and the visuals provided really help. I think that very few biology textbooks/reading material provide such a clear overview picture and link across concepts. Excellent course! 4) The concern re. GMOs is just touched upon - in such a case I think it would be good if you could take up specific queries, concerns raised in different countries and share your view on those. For example, Bt Brinjal in India. 5) I love the lab visits! Thank you again for this course!",4
68014,"Great introduction to machine learning, not too much math but gives a good idea of what ML is + gives practice in Python (which was my initial goal).The tests contained a few inaccuracies (they didn't completely match on my machine/setup), but otherwise was fine.",5
105111,This course help us to think more positively about entities and their efforts...,5
99252,A good thing about this course is that the course material are up to date enough and you wont come into many of issues that even professionals might get stuck in while they're updating to higher versions.,5
44096,It's useful for life and job.,4
44013,"very very useful to me , i learned a lot.",5
93767,"Very poorly constructed. There are major jumps in the difficulty of material that are completely unnecessary. The material could very easily be broken down into more manageable and comprehensible chunks. There is no repetition of any exercise or function to engrain any of the material. This course suffers grossly from the ""curse of knowledge"". If it were structured in a way where (a) material was broken down into smaller bits, ideally as beta tested by true rank novices and (b) all materials or specific functions were presented with repetition, similar to how khan academy structures its math section, then this course would be much better. I would also assume, given a and b, that there would be higher retention and comprehension. The expected time requirements are also wildly amiss. Try beta testing this on TRUE rank novices. The program suggests that this is for ""beginners"". I find it doubtful that a true beginner would fare well in this course.",1
77970,This class was very informative and easy for beginners to understand. The instructor was very good.,5
75555,"Thanks for everything. The course is very fun to follow, classes are clearly presented and explained, and SO informative. This a great introduction to coding and to python.",5
11354,"I am in love for this course. Unfortunately, in the first week I did not had much time to study and know I am late, but I will certainly catch up rhythm.",5
14276,Very good introduction to data science,5
25135,"Quite confused during the majority of this course, especially after how clear the first course was. Was able to follow instructions but did not fully understand why I was doing anything. Not enough foundation given. The final project came out of no where. We did not learn nearly enough in the course to be able to tackle that. The majority of steps that needed to be taken were not taught in class or if they were, they were glossed over. I was floored by how the class went form simple to extremely complicated with no transition phase.",1
105596,"It's a great, practical course!!!",5
47302,Very good course because you can use the described learning technics right away. Not only for learning but also as a help in daily life. Definitely recommend this course to everyone.,5
41896,Very good course with simple approach and extremely useful knowledge.,5

22767,"Interesting, lectures are easy to understand",5
101600,"This course is a great introduction to the art of script writing. You'll gain an understanding of basic script formatting, get in the habit of writing consistently and have the benefit of your script being reviewed by peers.",4
7156,"In this capstone project, you're given a framework to work with, and asked to create an app with pretty minimal required criteria. The problem is, there's very little instructions or support, so it feels like a classroom where the instructor said ""do whatever you want"" and walks out of the door. Overall the specialization feels ill-organized and of questionable quality, and there are plenty of negative sentiments in the forums.",1
61165,I am excited to join this course... very intriguing professor and material.,5

88503,SImple and easy to learn ...hope to help others some day..,5
16340,"Excellent overview on the major sociological thinkers from Adam Smith to Norbert Elias. A very good introduction to the subject. Beware though - the professor is an engaging teacher, but his quizzes are tough. You actually have to do some of the recommended readings to answer the questions - there are at least three questions in each quiz based on the writings of the sociologist who is the subject of the test.",5

87199,More assignments would help us more,4
52686,this's awesome!,5
21666,very good introduction but as i go through the videos and then do the quiz i feel like the material doesn't highlight exactly what is needed for the quiz. Maybe i'm not taking the video lecture as seriously as i should. Something else to reinforce the material cause it seems a bit condensed.thanks for a wonderful course!,4
93136,"While challenging, this course did more than simply lay out the basics of R. It moved me to think critically about specific tasks and innovate ways of solving problems using the language.",5
3765,The professor seems pretty nice and the class is great but even quizzes/answers and assignments are only available for payment,3
105152,"I must say that the information on writing in the course was good, and the example of sanding, giving a critique etc. was very useful to me as a writer just putting her work into the world. I was extremely disappointed that after laboring through 3 long stories, only one formatted in the way the course specified, and trying to write at least one page of comments on each that what I got in return was on good critique and two that were only two lines long. I was on scholarship so I did not pay for the course but it was disappointing that there was no moderation of the peer review side of the homework.",3
4306,This course is very challenging. I may not have had the proper background in mathematics to full absorb the material. Similarly I may have to busy of a lifestyle to have properly focused on this class.,3
5500,loved it! Learned a lot.,5

22399,"This is a great course, simple to understand and well-taught by Dean Kopman.",5
81910,I recommend this course because it gives importance to explain JavaScript applied to responsive sites. And not heavy to follow at all.,5
16414,Absolutely brilliant course with a variety of speakers from different backgrounds - loved it!,5
98482,+: I reached my goal for the course and now I understand a bit about R. I succeeded to pass within much shorter time than anticipated course duration. The course certificate is posted to my Linkedin profile.-: No human mentors on the course discussion forum - all questions answered by other students. Automatic tests in swirl are too restrictive and do not accept perfectly correct student solutions slightly different to those anticipated by the authors. Week 2 assignment is much different from the reading material. Nothing taught about charting in R.Overall comment: I think it is good value for money.,4
102909,Great learning !!!,5

89652,"It was an inspiring, very interesting course through which a person whether new to photography or not, can get a grip on the multiple aspects that involve photography. The course has a lot of useful and inspiring information, photographers, projects but mostly it is designed in such a way that many things are said and left to the participant to work on them. Very interesting , well done. Thank you.",5

13108,"Hello. Just noticed the new Competitive Strategy Specialization. Very much interested. Loved the first course. Made sense of all my old microeconomics classes.Nevertheless, I've already done Competitive Strategy Course with success and was already in the advanced one.If I do Specialization will I already receive a specific certificate for the course I did? Will I be able to pay a smaller fee for having done one course already?Final question, does the specialization have some specific certification from LMU?Thanks again.",5

83079,"I have one issue about week 4 ""Append"" tree. I did not get how Append correlates with binary digits. I would like to have some step by step example how will we create a tree like s1 = Single(1) appendLeaf Single(2), s2 = s1 appendLeaf Single(3), s3 = s2 appendLeaf Single(4), s4 = s4 appendLeaf Single(5) using binary digits?",4
74512,Good basic intro. Professor doesn't take himself too seriously which makes the lectures entertaining as well as informative. I would recommend this to someone who has no coding experience.I have some programming experience with Python. I didn't need to watch the lectures to answer the questions. There may need to be some way to 'exempt' out of certain courses to get to next course in the specialization.,5
97786,Great course!,5
23401,I'm beginning to take courses on Coursera. This is a four week course but can easily be done in one setting. Great information and material that can be used for a long time.Easy to follow. I'm going to try some of the recipes that were mentioned! And it's FREE!,5

3559,"UCSD always bring there A game, with fun projects and extensions to real world problems. I have completed all three courses.This course was especially informative as it dipped into the graph theory and the optimization problems we face.The course itself is fun and informative and may seem tough at times but is really rewarding once complete. Thanks guys and girls.",5

46230,"I came in with my own theories based on my experience only to find there is scientific backing almost everything I have been doing. An example would be dozing off or taking a nap in the middle of a test. Sure, the horror, or, that's ill advised. However, dozing off or taking a nap in the middle of a test allows my brain to go to diffuse mode. When I snap out of it or wake up I suddenly know the answer or how to go about reaching the solution. There has not been a single test I've taken where I took a nap and did not score within the top 5%.Everything I learned here will further augment what I know by experience but did not have scientific research to back up. Everything I learned will help me explain to others what it is I do to learn efficiently and how they can go about doing the same thing (maybe not falling asleep on a test ;P).This was very helpful, and includes loads of resources to read and or watch long after you are done to really solidify those chunks. Would recommend to anyone with the drive to learn deeper and better.",4

17003,"The content is definitely interesting. But I didn't see any ""Practice"" there... I didn't really get the difference theory vs practice between this course and the previous one ""Digital Analytics for Marketing Professionals: Marketing Analytics in Theory"".Sometimes the assignments were not very interesting, and didn't always help practicing the content exposed in the lectures... For example, the piece about the different statistical tools: I didn't get why it was included in the course... either we do exercises on it, or it shouldn't be in the course... but there is not point of knowing by heart the differences between the different statistical tools.The part about the customer decision journey, the plan for analytics, and the different analysis techniques were very interesting. I would have liked to see and practice more concretely how to collect data (e.g. how to perform clickstream analysis), etc.And the lectures should avoid general tips and guidelines (like ""5 things to avoid in order to""... the web is full of this kind of content)... I mean, it has to be ""in Practice"". And the professor should know exactly the content of his slides, and prepare his speech.Lastly, a lot of the suggested readings were from a blog that is really horrible to read... The author of the blog might be very knowledgeable on his subject, but his blog it is full of useless jokes, very long to read... I mean one of its articles could 3 times shorter if he gets straight to the point",3
72016,It was really nice course. Hopefully there is more intense course about Music Business or basic course about Music Marketing!,5

60045,"I give this course 4 stars as I did learn a lot from it, and thought most of it is well prepared and useful.I found some disappointment in some of the programming assignments where I wanted to understand the code better but it was not documented properly. In such cases the common response was that the material goes beyond the scope of the course.I thank Andrew Ng for the material and hope this gets resolved in the future.",4
47532,Fascinating neuro-related information is presented in an easily digestable way. Concepts are practical to implement.,5
75646,The pace is perfect for beginners. I've done a fair amount of programming in the past but I definitely appreciate how the tutor goes through the material patiently. The assignments were fairly easy for me due to my background but I thought they were challenging enough for any first-time programmers,5
46109,"That was my first online course and i have really enjoyed so much and gained a lot of precious ideas and concepts about different aspects of learning, My professor has shared it with my classmates and me, and i knew it won't be such a waste of time, I want to thank so much everyone who has contributed by any kind of help to create this course, especially Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski.",5
63379,"This is a complete waste of time. The other courses were really good but with this course I:Learned nothing newUnlearned best practises from the previous coursesMick doesn't seem to understand what he is presenting himself at times, the supplied code does not match the video's, the assignments change when I already submitted it (from upload a zip to deploy) and the assignments are copy pasted. I think it would help to take this part out of the specialisation.",1
